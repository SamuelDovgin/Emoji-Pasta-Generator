THE 🤲 MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0 🔞 




CHAPTER I. 👤 Down 👇 the ⬆ Rabbit-Hole 

Alice was 👏 beginning 🚵 to 🔵 get ✊ very 📈👿 tired 😴 of 🚫 sitting ♿ by 😡 her 💋 sister 👱 on 👈 the 👏 
bank, 🏦 and ⏳ of 👠 having 🚘 nothing 🙅🏼 to 👎🏻 do: 👌 once ☝🏻 or 👱🏻 twice 💥😵 she 👩👱 had 🍳✨😴 peeped 👀🤤 into ⬇ the 🏥 
book 📖 her ♓ sister 👼🏿 was 😭🅰😱 reading, 📖 but 🍑 it ✋🚫 had 💔 no 🚫 pictures 😘 or 👢 conversations in 📥 
it, 🙄 'and 👏 what 🎉 is 👌 the 👏👤 use 🤹 of 👶 a 👤 book,' 🙌🏼 thought 🧠💭 Alice 'without ❌😖 pictures 😘 or ❓ 
conversations?' 

So 💯 she 🐴 was 👍💦 considering in 💰 her 👱🏻 own 😂 mind 💪 (as 🅰 well 🤔 as 🧐 she 👊 could, 🤗 for 💣 the 🧼 
hot 🥵 day 🌞 made 🤗 her 👩🏾 feel 💗 very ♀ sleepy 💤😴 and 🦾 stupid), 😤 whether 💮 the 🍆 pleasure 🍌 
of 💦 making 👨🏻 a 😩 daisy-chain would 🎈🎁 be 👁 worth 💰 the 🕳 trouble ⚠ of ♦ getting 🤲 up 👆 and 😾👉👌 
picking ⛏ the 😭 daisies, when 😳🕐🤚 suddenly 😀 a 👏 White 👱 Rabbit 🐇🌰 with 🐸 pink 💖 eyes 👀 ran 🏃🏾🇺 
close 🤞🏻 by 🌩 her. 😫 

There 👌 was 💦😉🙃 nothing ☹ so 🌃 VERY 📈👿 remarkable in 🍂🏢🍳 that; 🏁👎🆔 nor 🅱 did 😭😳👻 Alice think 🤔 it 💁🏾 so 💯 
VERY 👌🍀 much ☝🏼 out 😡☠ of ♦ the 🤔 way ↕ to 😵 hear 👂 the 👏 Rabbit 🐰🤤🍆 say ⁉ to 💦 itself, 🚝 'Oh 😫 dear! 📝 
Oh 😧 dear! 🙌 I 👏🚕 shall 😋 be ♨ late!' 🤠 (when 🔵 she 👊 thought 💭 it 🤤 over 💅💖✨ afterwards, it 🍆 
occurred to ✌ her 💋 that 🧟 she 👱 ought to ➡ have ⚠ wondered at 🌚😴 this, 👈 but 🍑 at 🍆 the 💡 time 🕰 
it ⁉ all 💇 seemed 😡😠 quite ✅ natural); 🍃🌿👉 but 👏☝ when 😚 the 😁 Rabbit 🐇🌰 actually 👊 TOOK 😠 A 🔊😮 WATCH 📞 
OUT 🏎🏍 OF 🤒 ITS 🥳 WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and ➕ looked 👀👅 at ❗ it, 😩😳💦 and 👏 then 😂 hurried on, 👎 
Alice started 🆕 to 🗣 her ✋🏻👎 feet, 👣 for 💍💒✋ it 🪑 flashed across 🏘 her 🤤 mind ☝ that ❌ she 👱 had 💋 
never 🙅 before 😥😳😈 seen 👀🤔 a 👏 rabbit 😈😳 with 🥰 either 👎 a 🅰 waistcoat-pocket, or 💻 a 🍆 watch 👀 
to 🚟 take 🛃➕ out 💦 of 🌌👐 it, 😱 and 👏 burning 🔥 with 🙅 curiosity, she 💁 ran 🏃🏾🇺 across ✝ the 🤔 field 👇 
after 👀 it, 😓 and 👏 fortunately 🤠 was 👏 just ❗ in 😎 time 🕜🕡🕦 to ✌ see 👀 it 🇮🇹 pop 💥 down ⬇ a 💩 large 💰 
rabbit-hole under ❌ the 🧼 hedge. 

In 📥 another 👨🏾 moment 😳 down 😩👅 went 🏠 Alice after 😌 it, 🚗☝ never 🚫 once 🤞 considering how 🤔 
in ⚡ the 🚱 world 🌍 she 😘 was ❓📕📉 to 😦 get 🎁 out 🏎🏍 again. 👌🏼 

The 😳 rabbit-hole went 🚗 straight ➡ on 🔛💯 like 👍 a 👱🏻 tunnel 🎧 for 🙄 some 🏿👉👌 way, 💫 and 👏 then 😮 
dipped suddenly 🚼 down, ⬇ so 💯 suddenly 😀 that 😎 Alice had 👬 not 🚫 a 🔎♟ moment 😳 to 💦 think 💭 
about ❓ stopping 🛑 herself 🤷 before ⬅ she 🔖🐰 found 💪 herself 🤷 falling 🌇 down 🎅🏿 a 🔜🐏 very ♀ deep 😥 
well. 🍆😋 

Either 👎 the 🛍 well 😃 was 👏 very 🏽⚖ deep, 😱 or 🎥 she 🌘 fell 👇 very ☣💁 slowly, 🐌 for 😮 she 💎 had 🈶 
plenty of 🇺🇸 time 😒🙄 as 💭 she 👩🏾 went 🚶🏻 down ⬇ to 💲 look 😏 about 💦 her ♀ and ✅ to 👏 wonder 🔥 what 😅 was 🚼 
going 🚶 to 👏 happen 😱 next. ⌛⏳🔜 First, 🥇 she 😩🤣😘 tried 💨 to 👏 look 😏 down 😳 and 👏 make 📺 out 💦 what 🤷 
she 👩👱 was 👶🏼🔪 coming 😚🦵🏼 to, 👲🏼 but 👏☝ it 😛😜 was 😳 too 😎 dark 🏿🌑🕴 to 🚄🍍☝ see 👀 anything; 🏻🍑 then 🍌 she ✋ 
looked 👀 at 👉👌 the ❄ sides of 🌈🥜 the 🎷🎺 well, 🦠😷🤒 and ➕ noticed 👧🏾 that ☝ they 👨 were 🤔🧐🤓 filled 🥛 with 💩 
cupboards and ☝ book-shelves; 📘 here ⤵ and 👶🏽🛄 there 👌 she 🎳 saw 👀 maps and 💭⭐ pictures 😘 
hung 🍆🍑 upon 👦 pegs. She ♀👩 took 🌸👌🏿 down 😭😳 a 💦 jar 🏺 from ⛔ one 😭☝ of 🍢🔺🔨 the 🦊😛🗿 shelves as 🅰 
she 👱 passed; ✅ it 🤭🤔🧐 was 🥺 labelled 'ORANGE 🍊🍑 MARMALADE', but 🍑 to 🍰😘💦 her 😊 great 🤔❓ 
disappointment it 💯 was 👏 empty: 😈 she 🔖🐰 did 😌 not 🗿 like ✔ to 🕙🌵⬆ drop 🚮⬇ the 👏 jar 🏺 for 👲🏻 fear 😱 
of 💰💦 killing 💰😈 somebody, 😷 so 💯 managed to 💦 put 🧼 it 😘 into 🤩 one ☝🏼 of 💦 the ✝ cupboards as ☝🏾❓ 
she 🐴 fell 😲🥱 past 👶🏽 it. 💋 

'Well!' 🤔 thought 💭 Alice to 🤬 herself, 🤷 'after 👏 such 😆 a 💯 fall 🛌 as 🍼💳😫 this, 👈 I 🙋🏼 shall 🐚 
think 🤔 nothing 👏🔫🤙 of 🙃 tumbling down 👇👌 stairs! 😑 How 👁 brave 🐎 they'll 👮 all 💯 think 🤔 me 🚓🔻🏍 at 🤣😂 
home! 🏚 Why, 🤔 I 🙋🏼 wouldn't 🚫 say 🗣👶🏽 anything 👓 about 🌄 it, 🇮🇹 even 🌙 if 🤴🏻 I 😬 fell 👇 off 📴 the 👉🏻 top 🔝 
of 😒 the 👏 house!' 🏠◀ (Which 💀 was 🔚 very 😔 likely 🐋 true.) 😃 

Down, ⤵ down, ⬇ down. 🔆🤜🏻 Would 🌲 the 🚗 fall 🔥 NEVER ❌ come 🔜🗺 to ➖➗➕ an ❄ end! 🤤🤔😭 'I 👀 wonder 🤔 how 🤔 
many 👁🦷 miles 🛣 I've 🙋 fallen 🤸🏻 by ✍🏻 this 😤 time?' ⌚ she ❓ said 🗣 aloud. 'I 🌵 must 💪🏽 be ➡ getting 😷 
somewhere near 😯 the 🤲 centre 🔲 of 💦 the 😭 earth. 👮🏼 Let 🌸 me 🔙 see: 👀 that 🏼✋👇 would 🦊 be 🐝 four 🍀 
thousand ♾ miles 🛣 down, 👇 I 👁 think--' 🤔 (for, 🚨🙇🏼 you 👵 see, 👁 Alice had ✊ learnt several 🔢🎎👵 
things 🤫 of 👏🏻 this 🅱 sort in 👏 her 👩 lessons in 🅾 the ⛓👩 schoolroom, and 😱 though ❌ this 😎😘 
was ✅ not ❌ a 🚗 VERY 🙌 good 👌 opportunity for 💦 showing 📺 off 😤 her 🙎 knowledge, 🎓🤓🤑 as 🧐 there 👹 
was 👏 no 😱 one 👀 to ✔ listen 👂‼ to 🌎🌋 her, ❄ still 😡 it 🤒 was 👏 good 👌 practice ❤ to 🗣 say 🗣 it 🍼 over) 📄 
'--yes, 👄🤤 that's ✔ about 🌟 the 🌕 right 👌 distance--but then 👩 I 😎 wonder 🤷 what 😡 Latitude 
or 💁 Longitude I've 🙋🏻 got 🙄 to?' 👉💰🎉 (Alice had 🙋🏼🈸 no 🚫😔🏳 idea 🤔 what ❓ Latitude was, 😳 or 👏 
Longitude either, ↔ but 🍑 thought 💭 they 😡 were 👶 nice 👌 grand 🤱 words 📝 to 💦 say.) 💬 

Presently she 🤐 began 👳🏿 again. ⤵ 'I 👁 wonder 🤔 if 👏 I 😈 shall 🐚 fall 🛌 right ➡ THROUGH 😩 the 🔲 
earth! 🌏🌍🌎 How 🤔 funny 😃 it'll 🤣 seem ♍ to 😉😯 come 👊 out 🙅 among the 🌃 people 👫 that 👧 walk 👣 with 💦 
their 🍆 heads 😂 downward! The 📈⬆ Antipathies, I 👏🏾 think--' 💭🧠 (she 🏻👦🧒 was 📩 rather 👉 glad 
there 👌 WAS 👏 no 😣 one ☝ listening, 🗣👂 this 👈 time, 😻 as 💰😴 it ❗ didn't 🚷🗳 sound 👛 at 🍆 all 👷🏾💃 the 🐫😜 
right ✔ word) 👄🔉 '--but 🤪 I 👧 shall 🐚 have 🤲 to ✌ ask 😪 them 💦 what 😅 the 🚷 name 🤭🧐❓ of 👏🏻 the 🐎 country 🤫 
is, 😔 you 🍃 know. 🤔 Please, 😂 Ma'am, 🚺 is 😐🈶 this 😂 New 👶🏻 Zealand or 🎥 Australia?' 🇦🇺 (and 💗 
she 💎 tried 💪 to 🔟 curtsey as 😎 she ❌ spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as 🅰 you're 👉🏻🙍 falling 🌇 
through 👽 the 🇺🇸 air! ☁ Do 😜 you 👉🤑 think 💭🤔 you 👈 could 🔒 manage it?) 🤲🖐 'And 😂 what 👌🏻 an 🎓👳🏼 
ignorant 😂📰 little ❤ girl ☝ she'll think 🤔🤓 me 👏 for 🍶 asking! ⁉ No, 😂 it'll 🤣 never ❌ do 🛠 to 🆔 
ask: 💂🏽 perhaps 💯 I 🙂 shall 😋 see 👀 it 😗😛🍏 written 📝 up 🆙 somewhere.' 

Down, 👇 down, ⬇ down. 👇 There 👗👠💋 was 🥺 nothing 🙅🏼 else 🤔 to ✌ do, 😭 so 💯 Alice soon 🔜 began 🔘 
talking 🙊 again. 🧍🏻 'Dinah'll miss 😉 me 😊 very 👍 much 🥰😁🤪 to-night, 🌑 I 🙍🏻 should 💘💊👑 think!' 🤔 
(Dinah was 🤪 the 💋 cat.) 😾 'I 🙍🏻 hope 👆🏾👕 they'll ❤ remember 🧠 her 👱 saucer of 😂 milk 🐮 at 🍆 
tea-time. Dinah my 👨 dear! 📝 I 💁🏻💖 wish 🌠 you 😈 were 🎉 down ⬇ here 👈 with 🖐🏻💥 me! 💆🏽 There 👌 are 👉 no 🚫 
mice in 👏 the 👜🎒😍 air, 🌬🌟😵 I'm 🚫🌎 afraid, 😦 but 💪 you ☝ might 🤯 catch 👊🏽✊ a ✨ bat, 🏏 and ⚠ that's ✔ very ❗🙌 
like 😄 a 👌 mouse, 🐀 you 🧠👀 know. 🤔 But 👏 do 👤 cats 😹 eat 😋🍦🌸 bats, 🦇 I 🤠 wonder?' 🤔 And 👏 here 👏 Alice 
began 👳🏿 to 👏 get 🉐 rather 📯💅🏾 sleepy, 💤😴 and 👱🏾 went 🚶🏼 on ⬇ saying 🗣 to 👊 herself, 🤷 in 🤫 a 😒 dreamy 
sort of 🐮 way, 😧 'Do 😛 cats 👌 eat 💧😋👅 bats? 🦇 Do ⛔ cats 😹 eat 😋🍦🌸 bats?' 🦇 and 👉🏻 sometimes, 😣 'Do 💩 
bats 🦇 eat 😋🍦🌸 cats?' 🐱👌 for, 👿 you 👁 see, 🍴 as 🍑 she 👉👩🏾 couldn't 🤷 answer 🤤 either ↔ question, 🤷 
it 🚫 didn't 🙅🏻🚫 much ⚠ matter ✊🏾🏿 which 🧙 way 🙏🏻 she 🚺⬅ put 👏🏾 it. 🌁 She 👱 felt 😩 that 👦 she 👩🏾 was 🎼 dozing 
off, 🤤 and 😹📒🎅 had 😎 just 👏 begun ⛔ to 🤟 dream ♦ that 🤩 she 🤦 was 👏 walking 🍗 hand 🖐🏿 in 🚶🏼 hand 🎈 with 👏 
Dinah, and 💵🔄👶 saying 🤠 to 🌽 her 🌝 very 😲❗ earnestly, 'Now, 😮 Dinah, tell 😯 me 😊 the 👏 truth: ™👌 
did 🙀😳 you 🏻👉🙍 ever 📆 eat 👉 a 💯😎🏿 bat?' 🏏 when ⏰ suddenly, 😨 thump! thump! down 🔻 she 💎 came 💦 upon 👦 
a ⌛ heap of 🤒 sticks 🏒 and 🌎 dry 🤡 leaves, 🍑🍆💦 and 👏 the 🏽👉🤜 fall 🛌 was 📞 over. 🔹😋 

Alice was 🐈 not 🚫 a 🚗 bit 😵🐕 hurt, 🤕⛑ and 😤 she 🏻👦🧒 jumped 🦘 up ⬆ on 🔥👉 to 🤤😩🍔 her 😊 feet 🦶 in 📅 a 👌 moment: ✌😋👌 
she 🤐 looked 👀 up, 📈 but ☝ it 😑 was 🙉 all 🙂☺😊 dark 😈 overhead; before 🤨 her 😩 was 💔 another 🚪 
long 🕐 passage, 😩😍😘 and 🍆🏻 the 😱 White ✖ Rabbit 😈😳 was 🙏 still 💯 in 👏 sight, 👀 hurrying down 👇 it. 🚫🍖 
There ✔ was 🙃 not 🤬👎🚫 a 👌 moment ⚠ to 😵 be 🐝 lost: ☠ away 👉🏻 went 👏 Alice like 😄 the 🐺 wind, 🍂🍃 and 💞 
was 🚼 just ☁ in 👅💦 time 💶 to 🕑 hear 💪🏽🐃 it 🇮🇹 say, 🗣 as 💭 it 🎷 turned ⤴ a 👌💰😤 corner, ➡ 'Oh 😳⁉ my 🙈 ears 🎶😍🎵 
and 👏 whiskers, ✨ how 🤔 late 🕛 it's ❌ getting!' ◀ She 🙏🏻 was 😩 close 🌍 behind ↩ it 🗣 when 🍑 she 💁 
turned ↪ the 💺 corner, ➡ but 🤷🏼 the 🛫 Rabbit 😈😳 was 👏 no 😣 longer 🤪 to 👉 be 🐝 seen: 👀 she 👂🏽 found 👀🧐 
herself 🤷 in 🚵 a 💀 long, 😩🍆 low 🔉 hall, 🎪 which 🧙 was 👏 lit 🔥 up 🔝👐🏻 by 👀 a 💀 row 🛤 of 🤮 lamps hanging 🤸 
from 🍆✊🏻 the 🕡🕜 roof. 

There ✔ were 😵 doors all 🌝 round ⭕⚪⚫ the 💺 hall, 🏫 but 🍑 they ✨😭😈 were 🎊 all 😭😢😵 locked; 👧🏼 and 🎁👼 when ⏰ 
Alice had 🈶 been 😔 all 💯 the 😜😝 way ➡ down 😭😳 one 🖕 side 👈👉 and 💅🏾 up 👆🥬 the 🏼 other, 👇☝ trying 💙😈 every ☝ 
door, 🔑 she 👵👱 walked 🍴 sadly 😞 down ⬇ the 🌊 middle, ❗ wondering how 💯 she 💪 was 🌬 ever 👭 to 👈 
get 🉐 out 💯 again. 🙄😒 

Suddenly 😨 she ♀👩 came 🚶 upon 👦 a 🍄 little 🤏 three-legged table, 🪑 all 👮 made 👏 of 💦 solid 🎱 
glass; 🥃 there 👌🌃 was 😭 nothing ☹ on 💣 it 🤔❓⁉ except 🅰 a 🚗 tiny 😑 golden 🤩 key, 🔑 and 👏 Alice's 
first 💒 thought ⛽ was 👍💦 that 😐 it 🧐 might ❔ belong 🙋🏽 to 🔀👱🆒 one 👆🏻 of 👉 the 🧼 doors of 😩 the 😁 hall; 🎪 
but, 😞 alas! either 🐛 the 🇺🇸👌 locks were 👶 too 🙁 large, 👀 or 😶 the 👏 key 💗🧚 was 👏 too 😡 small, 😔 
but 👏 at 🍆 any 🙅🏼 rate 💨 it 🗣 would 🎄 not ❌ open 💯🅱 any 🙅🏿 of 💦 them. 🌈 However, 🖐💯 on 🏃🏼 the 🙅🏻😠 second ❗🕐 
time ⏰ round, 🔁 she ✋ came 💦 upon 👦 a 🦠 low 🔉 curtain she 😩🤣😘 had 🈶 not ✋ noticed 🔎 before, ↩ and 👨 
behind ↩ it 😤 was 👏 a 🚗 little 📷 door 🚪 about 😎 fifteen inches high: ⬆ she 💇 tried 🙅🏻 the 💯 
little 👌 golden 🤩 key 🔑 in 👌👀 the 🚴 lock, 🔒 and 🤤 to 🤑 her 🙎🏼 great 😁👍 delight 🤤 it 🇮🇹 fitted! 🤠 

Alice opened 😅💃🏿 the 👏 door 🚪 and 😑 found 👀👈 that 🥵 it 💴 led into 📐 a 👌 small ⬇ passage, 😩😍😘 not 😱 
much ♥ larger than 😠 a 🚗 rat-hole: she 😍🍆💦 knelt down ⏬ and 🕳 looked 👀 along 😍 the 🏠 passage 😫😍😘 
into 📩📥 the 🗣 loveliest garden you 🔫🔪 ever 🚫🛑 saw. 👀 How 🤔 she 👵👩 longed to 👉 get 👅 out 🤳🏻 of 🅱 
that 👧 dark 🌑 hall, 🎪 and ➕ wander about ⁉ among those 🐥 beds of 🏻🚋 bright 🌟💫 flowers 🌷 and 💀 
those 👏 cool 👌🌃 fountains, but 😡😤 she 💪 could 😷 not 🙅 even 🥵 get 🉐 her 😌 head 💆 through 👉 the 👏 
doorway; 'and 👑 even 🤖 if 👏 my 👨 head 👱 would 👪 go 🚶 through,' 👽 thought 🧠 poor 😥 Alice, 'it 😲👁 
would 🤲🏻 be 👏💪 of 💦 very 👤 little 🤏🏻 use 🤹 without ❌😖 my 🤬🤠👿 shoulders. Oh, 🙀 how 🤔 I 👁 wish 🙏 I 😈 could 🔒 
shut 🤫 up ☝ like 👍 a 👸 telescope! I 👁 think 💭 I 🙋🏼 could, 🃏 if 😳 I 👁 only 🕦 knew ☠ how ✨ to 🏎 begin.' 👊 
For, 🤷🏾 you 😩🥰 see, 👀 so 💯 many 🍺👧👨 out-of-the-way things 🍞 had 🥵 happened 🤔 lately, 💪🏾😨 
that 😯 Alice had 🤩🎉🎊 begun ⛔ to 🐝👀 think 🤔 that 🤔 very 👌 few 🤰 things 💣🔪 indeed 😂 were 👶 really 😞 
impossible. 😳 

There 👌 seemed 🤔 to 🅱 be 🅱 no 🚫 use 😡 in 👏 waiting 🕚🕕🕠 by 😎 the 👏 little 💃😣 door, 🚪 so 👴🏾 she 👊 went 👏 
back ⬅ to 🌭 the 👉 table, 📲⛩ half 🌓 hoping 🙏🏻 she 👩 might 🤔 find 👀 another 🔄 key 🔑 on 😭 it, 💦 or 👴🏿 at 👻🕷👹 
any 👩 rate 💯🎨 a 🍆 book 📚🤩 of 💦 rules 🚷 for 🤣 shutting people 🗑 up 🆙🔼⬆ like 🏩 telescopes: this 🤝 
time ⌛ she 👵👩 found 💪 a 🗝 little 👌 bottle ⚡ on 💦🌴 it, ✊🏾👎 ('which ⁉ certainly 🔗 was 👏 not 🚫 here ⭕ 
before,' ✝ said 🚺 Alice,) and 👣 round 🔁 the 💡 neck 🎺 of 🏳 the 🔨 bottle 🍾 was 🔙 a 🚗 paper 📃 
label, 🏢 with 😂 the 👏 words 👵🏼 'DRINK 🍹 ME' 📲 beautifully printed 🖨🍆 on 👈 it 💋 in 💕 large 👀 
letters. 🆑 

It 😲 was 👏 all 💯 very 🙌 well 🦠😷🤒 to 👮 say 🗣 'Drink 🍷🍹🍾 me,' 😐 but 🤗 the 👏 wise 🧙 little 🤏 Alice was 👏 
not ❗ going 😂 to ➖➗➕ do 🌌 THAT 👩 in 😐 a 🤩 hurry. 'No, 🙅 I'll 👈 look 👀 first,' ☝🏻 she 😪🐆🔷 said, 💬👱🏿 'and 👏🏿👸 
see ✋😎👽 whether 💮 it's 😜😂 marked "poison" 🐍 or 😩 not'; 🚫 for 🍆 she 👱 had 💋 read 💟 several 🔢🎎👵 nice 👋🤠👊 
little 🚸 histories about 🔥🗣🤡 children 👶 who 💁 had 💔 got 👀 burnt, and ⬛ eaten 👄🍴 up ⬆ by ❌ wild ☁ 
beasts 🍆🍑 and ➕ other 👨 unpleasant things, 🙋 all 💯 because 🚬 they 👥 WOULD 👪 not ❌ remember 🙌😇 
the 💧 simple 🍦 rules 👑 their 👈⚠🍆 friends 👯 had 🈶 taught 👩🏾 them: 👏 such 😆 as, 💆 that 😍 a 👌 red-hot 
poker will 👋 burn 🔥 you 👈 if 🤥👏 you 👊 hold 🤲 it 💯 too 😡 long; 📏 and 🌌👐 that 😤 if 👏 you 💯👧 cut ✂ your 👉 
finger 👉 VERY ⚖💁 deeply 💨🌬 with 💪 a 😍 knife, 🔪 it 🇮🇹 usually 😌😊 bleeds; and 💀 she 📺 had 💋 never ❌ 
forgotten 💯😫😭 that, 🤨 if 🅱 you 🤲 drink 😋 much 😢😭😿 from ◼ a 🔪🙅👶 bottle 🍾 marked 'poison,' 🐍 it 🇮🇹☔ is 👁👅 
almost 💘 certain 🙋 to 💦 disagree 😡 with 👩 you, 👏 sooner or 👹 later. 🕑 

However, 🖐 this 👉 bottle 🍾 was 😭 NOT 🙅 marked 'poison,' 🐍 so 😁 Alice ventured to 🗣 taste 👅 
it, 🍼 and 🦾 finding 👀 it 💰 very 🍀 nice, 👍 (it 💁🏾 had, 💋 in ➡ fact, 🤥🙅 a 🦋 sort of 🙃 mixed 🆙 flavour 🍽 
of 🇺🇸 cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, 🍍 roast 🔥 turkey, 🦃 toffee, and 👏 hot ❄ 
buttered toast,) 🍞 she 🐰💦 very 😟 soon ⏰ finished 🤤 it ⁉ off. 📴

* * * * * * * 

'What 😦 a 🅰 curious 🆚🚴🏿 feeling!' 🤫😧 said 💬 Alice; 'I 👱🏻 must 😏 be 😒 shutting up 😑 like 👍 a 🔪 
telescope.' 

And 🖖 so 💴🚙 it 😩😳💦 was 👏 indeed: 😂 she 👶👧 was 👍💦 now 🎓 only 🕦 ten 💯🔟 inches high, 😇🅾 and 💯 her 💋 face 🙎 
brightened up ❤ at 🍔 the 🧼 thought 💭 that 👉 she 👵👩 was ✔ now 😎 the 🤚✋🏻 right ✔ size 🦐👌 for 🅰 going 🏃 
through 👉 the 👄🔯 little 👌 door 🚪 into 👉🏻👌 that 👅 lovely 😊 garden. First, 🥇 however, 🖐 she 😪🐆🔷 
waited for 🅰 a 🐶 few 🖐 minutes ⚠ to 💋 see 👀 if 💁 she ♀ was ◾ going 🚶🏻 to 👂 shrink ➡ any 🙅 further: 😵 
she 👊 felt 😎 a 😤 little 🤏🏻 nervous 😓 about ✋🏿 this; 🍕 'for 😯🤭 it 🇮🇹 might 🇸🇯🇾 end, 🔚 you 🖌 know,' 🔍✏ said 🗣 
Alice to 🎶 herself, 👩👊😭 'in ➡ my 🤤 going 👉 out 😝🤡😜 altogether, like 😄 a 🤕💦 candle. I 😂 wonder 🤔 
what 😦 I 👨🏽🗾 should 💘👑💦 be 👺 like 💦👅 then?' 👣💕 And ☝🏿👏 she ✋ tried 🙅🏻 to 👊 fancy 💰 what 😅 the 😈 flame 🔥👊🏻 of 👮 a 🅱 
candle is 🈶 like 👅👍 after ❌😜 the 🐺 candle is 🈶 blown 💀 out, ✅🔬🦠 for 😮 she 👊 could 💥⚰☠ not 👸🏻 remember 💆 
ever ♾🛠 having 😋 seen 👀 such 😲🤤😢 a 😰 thing. 📦 

After ❌😜 a 🏄🆙💟 while, 👱🏻 finding 🕵🏻 that 🐧 nothing 🚫 more 🕐 happened, 💯🌝🌞 she 🏻👦🧒 decided 👯 on 👇 going 🏃🏻 
into 👉 the 😯😩 garden at 👌🍆😏 once; ☝🏻 but, 😩 alas for 🗣🎙❓ poor 😔 Alice! when 💯 she 👱 got 😳 to 🐀🔭💦 the 👉 
door, 🔑 she 🐴 found 👀 she 👀 had 🥵 forgotten 🏺📝 the 🧼 little 🏼👧👸 golden 🤩 key, 🔑 and 😂 when 🚶 she ✋ 
went 😂💯👉 back ⬅ to 💦 the 🍑 table 🪑 for 🍆 it, 👌 she 👧 found 👀 she 👩🏼 could 🤔 not 😥 possibly 🤷 reach 🤲👐🙌 
it: 💥☝🏿 she 🚪 could 😮🐗 see 👁 it 🔐 quite ✅ plainly through ➡ the 👐 glass, 🥛 and 💩 she ♀ tried 🙅🏻 her 👩 
best 👌💯 to 💦 climb 😫🙌 up ✋😤 one 😤 of 💦 the ⚡❄ legs 😂 of 🐦🐤 the 🧐 table, 🪑 but 👳🏿 it 😛😝🍦 was 🏄🏼🐧 too 😟 slippery; 
and 😍 when 🔜 she ⛰ had 🈶 tired 😴 herself 👩👊😭 out 😳 with 😭👌 trying, 💯 the 🇺🇸 poor 🚫💲 little 👌 thing 🏆 
sat 🚌 down 🔻 and 👏 cried. 😫 

'Come, 🦵 there's 🚫 no 😣 use 😡 in 👨 crying 😢 like 😍 that!' 👏🏻 said 💬 Alice to 👨 herself, 👩👊😭 
rather 📯💅🏾 sharply; 'I 👧 advise 🤔 you 👏 to 👴💩 leave 👏 off 🚶 this 🏡♥ minute!' ⏳ She 🤷 generally 
gave 🎁 herself 👩👊😭 very 😲☣ good 👌 advice, 😤 (though 💥 she 🙏🏻 very ✅⛪ seldom followed 🚓 it), 🤏 
and ⏳ sometimes ⏰ she 👵👱 scolded herself 👩👊😭 so 💯 severely as 🤡 to 🗣 bring 👉 tears 😂 into 👨 
her 👨🏾 eyes; 🍢💑 and ✅ once ☝ she ✋ remembered trying 😣 to 🅱 box 🎁 her 👬 own 👤👍 ears 👂 for ☝ having 👁👌👀 
cheated herself 👩👊😭 in 👨 a 💰 game 🏓 of 🇪🇸 croquet she ❓ was 👏 playing 🎲 against 🦶🏻 herself, 👩👊😭 
for 🍆 this 💯👉👈 curious 🤓 child 👶 was 👏 very 😔 fond of 🍳💦 pretending 🤔 to 😛🧙 be 💦 two 🐜 people. 👨👩👶 
'But 😞 it's 🕙 no 😣 use 😻 now,' ⏰ thought 💭 poor 😔 Alice, 'to 🐷 pretend 🎥 to ‼ be 😥 two ✌🏼 people! 👪👨 
Why, 🤔♀ there's ❎ hardly 👄 enough 💦 of 👩 me 🙈💁🏻 left 😭 to 💰 make 💁 ONE 🤔 respectable person!' 🙋 

Soon ⏰ her 😶😯 eye 👁 fell 🛌 on 🔛 a 🤠 little 🤏 glass 🚰 box 🥊 that 😐 was 🏦 lying 👉 under ⬇ the 👏 table: ✋↪ 
she ⛰ opened 😅💃🏿 it, 💯 and 💦 found 😮 in 🏂↙ it 💯✋ a 😀 very ☣ small 😏 cake, 🍽🎂🍰 on 🔛 which 👏 the 👨 words 📝 
'EAT 😝 ME' 👮 were 😂 beautifully marked in ⬇ currants. 'Well, 👀🤷 I'll 👤 eat 👌 it,' 👷 said 🗣 
Alice, 'and ➕ if 💁 it 😩😳💦 makes 💵🤔 me 🙋🏼 grow 🌱😪 larger, I 👁🙌🏻 can 💦 reach ⬆ the 🎷🎺 key; 🔑 and ☑ if 🙃 it 👨 
makes 💘 me 🍆💦 grow ⬆ smaller, 💀 I 🙂 can 💰💦 creep under ⬇ the 👏 door; 🚪 so ☝ either 🐛 way 👉 I'll 👤 
get 🔟 into 🔜 the 😈 garden, and 👀 I 🙍🏻 don't ❌ care 😎 which ❗ happens!' 👀🙏 

She ♀ ate 🤤 a 🚗 little 🤏 bit, 😵🐕 and 👟 said 🗣 anxiously to 👃🏾 herself, 🤷 'Which ♀😡 way? 👉 Which 😸👏🐙 
way?', 😫 holding 👬 her 👩 hand 😳🤚 on 🔛 the 👧🏽 top 🔝 of 🇺🇸 her 👩 head 👱 to 🅱 feel 😁 which 🧙 way 🙀 it 🍆 was 👎 
growing, 😂 and 😂 she 👩🏾 was ⏮ quite ✅ surprised 😱 to 💦 find 👏 that 😳😚 she 👊 remained the 😮 same 🤷 
size: 🌟 to 🗣 be 😤 sure, ☝ this 👅 generally happens 👀🙏 when ➕ one ☝ eats cake, 🎂 but 🍑 Alice 
had 🈶 got 🧶 so 💉 much 😩😂🙀 into 🐣 the 🕡🕜 way 📍 of 🗜💦 expecting nothing 🚫 but 🤔 out-of-the-way 
things 🛍🤝 to 💦 happen, 😱 that 👊👋 it 🏇🏾👂 seemed 🚹🚤 quite ✅ dull and 👏 stupid 😴💀 for 😤 life 👶 to 💦 go 👉 on 🔛 
in 🔗 the ⛰ common 🏻🧑🚫 way. 👉 

So 💯 she 👩 set 📐 to 😋 work, 💊 and 🧖 very 👌 soon 🔜 finished 👅 off ✌ the 👉🏻 cake. 🎂

CHAPTER II. The 🧼 Pool 👨🏼 of 👎🏿 Tears 💧 

'Curiouser and 😭 curiouser!' cried 😢😖 Alice (she ⛰ was 💦 so 🕥 much 🥰😁🤪 surprised, 😱 that 😐 
for 🤣 the 🌄 moment 🕰📜💖 she 👱 quite ✅ forgot ☄ how 🤔 to 🐷 speak 👄 good 👌 English); 🇬🇧 'now 👄 I'm 🙋🏼 
opening out 🤬 like 💖 the 🎂 largest telescope that 😔😭🤖 ever 👭 was! ⏮ Good-bye, 👋 feet!' 👟 
(for 🥰 when 🍑 she 🏻👦🧒 looked 👀 down 🎎 at 🅱 her 👩 feet, 🦶 they 👥 seemed 🤔 to 🎴 be ⚠ almost 👌🏽 out 😳🖐 of 💐

_I_ 👧 shan't be 👶 able! 💪 I 😋 shall 🐚 be 🐝 a 🚗 great 😁👍 deal 🤝 too 👈 far 👉👀 off ⛔ to 😱 trouble ⚠

to 📝 go! 🚶 Let ✅ me 🙋🏼 see: 👁 I'll 😻 give 💇🏾 them 🔪☠ a 👌 new ✨ pair of 🇺🇸 boots 👢 every ❗ Christmas.' 🎅🥵🤪 

And 💦 she 👊 went 🚶🏼 on 🔛 planning 📆 to 😫 herself 🤷 how 🤔 she 👱 would 👪 manage it. 💯 'They 🍆 must 💯

Oh 😂 dear, 📝 what 👌🏻 nonsense 🙄🙃🤪 I'm 🙋🏼 talking!' 🗣 

Just 👏 then 😧👋 her 👩 head 🗣 struck against 🦶🏻 the 🌍 roof of 😬 the 😒 hall: 🎪 in 🚵 fact 😌💚🔤 she 🚺⬅ was 🙏

'Speak 👄 English!' 🇬🇧 said 💬👱🏿 the 🌎 Eaglet. 'I 👱 don't 🤔 know 🤔 the 😴 meaning ☝ of 👉 half 🤷🏻 
those 🌴 long ⚡ words, 🆔 and, ✅ what's 😉 more, ❕ I 🙋 don't ❌ believe 🧚🏽 you 👆🏼 do 😍 either!' ↔ And 👏 
the 🧼 Eaglet bent down 💫💪 its 🤔 head 💆 to 🎷 hide 🙈 a 🔔 smile: 😁 some ➕⏰ of 💡 the 🧼 other 🙌👆 birds 🍆🍌 
tittered audibly. 

'What 👌🏻 I 👁 was 🤨 going ⚡ to ✌ say,' 🗣 said 👆 the 👏 Dodo 🏻🖐😩 in 🤠 an 👹😤 offended 😠😡 tone, 👌 'was, 📞 that 👧 
the 🤤 best 🥇 thing 💋 to 👉 get 🉐 us 🌊 dry ☂ would 🌴 be ✊ a 😲 Caucus-race.' 

'What 🤔 IS 🤨 a 😂 Caucus-race?' said 🗣 Alice; not 👏 that 🤗💦🥛 she ⛰ wanted ⚠ much ❤ to 💦 know, 🤔 
but 👆🍑👀 the 🦶 Dodo 🏻🖐😩 had 💔 paused as 🍑 if 😂 it 👀 thought 💭 that 👩👨👧 SOMEBODY 👱 ought to ✌ speak, 👄 
and 👏 no 😫 one 🕐✅✔ else 😩 seemed 🚹🚤 inclined to 💦 say 🗣 anything. 💰 

'Why,' 🤔 said 🤤 the 🤠 Dodo, 🏻🖐😩 'the 😗😂😅 best 👌 way 💫 to 🤜🍑 explain 🙇🏼 it 🍆 is 🐐 to 🐩 do 👌 it.' 😂 (And, 🤤 as ☺😇😉 
you 👉 might 🤷 like 😤 to 💔 try 👻 the 😶 thing 👩 yourself, 🎓📈 some 🤏 winter ❄☃ day, 🌎👈 I 😢 will 🍆 tell 🗣 
you 😍 how 🤔 the 👏 Dodo 🏻🖐😩 managed it.) 🇮🇹 

First 🍆💦🍑 it 😂 marked out 🤏🍆 a 💦👌👱 race-course, in 👏 a 🚹 sort of 👉 circle, 🉐 ('the 😂🤣 exact 💯 
shape 🍕📈◼ doesn't 🤔 matter,' 🚞🔐 it 🤬 said,) 🙈 and 👏 then 😏 all 💥💉 the 👏 party 😂 were 🌏 placed 🐢🏊💨 
along 🔄 the 🐳 course, 👴🏿 here 📞🐉🦖 and 😏 there. 🐔 There 💦 was 🉑 no 🚫😔🏳 'One, 😤😖😲 two, ✌🏻 three, 👨 and 🍖 
away,' 💗 but 🚫 they ✨😭😈 began 🆚 running 🏃 when ⏰ they 👉👶 liked, 👍🏻 and 🏽 left 👈 off ☺ when 💁🏾 they 💦 
liked, 👍🏻 so 💯 that 😐 it 👌🏻 was 👽 not 🙅🏼 easy 🎄 to 🔟 know 🧠 when ⏰ the ☁ race 👏 was 👱🏾🏮 over. 👏 However, 🖐 
when 💁🏾 they 🆙 had 🈶 been 👀 running 🏃 half 🌜 an 🍳 hour 🕓 or 💁 so, 💯 and 🌱💪🏻 were 🤔🧐🤓 quite 🎩 dry 😵 again, 🗣 
the 👑 Dodo 🏻🖐😩 suddenly 😮 called 📞 out 😖 'The 🧼 race 🏿🏃🚴 is 🈶 over!' 👏 and 🏆 they 😳 all 💦 crowded 👥 
round ⭕⚪⚫ it, 👩 panting, and 👑 asking, ⁉ 'But 🍑 who 💁 has 🍡 won?' 😉 

This ⬆ question 🤔 the 😁 Dodo 🏻🖐😩 could 🤔 not 🚫 answer ✅ without 🙅 a 🤣😍 great 🤔❓ deal 🚫 of 💦 thought, 💭 
and 👣 it 💩😡😠 sat 🚌 for 🍆 a 🅰 long 🦒 time ⏱ with 💡 one 💽 finger 👉😍 pressed 👇 upon 👦 its 🇮🇹 forehead 😪 
(the 🚴 position 🏢 in 👏 which 👏 you 👉🏻 usually 😌😊 see 😵 Shakespeare, in 👏 the 🤚 pictures 😘

'EVERYBODY 🧐 has 🐝 won, 😉 and 💯 all 💥💉 must 🔒 have ✊😛😁 prizes.' 🏅 

'But 🍑 who 👉 is 🙀 to 😂 give 🤲🏻 the 😂 prizes?' 🏅 quite 🎩 a 🌹 chorus 🐊📊🍏 of 🗜💦 voices 😂 asked. 😢 

'Why, ❓🤔 SHE, 👵👱 of 🙇🏻🔄 course,' 💯👌👀 said 🧞 the 😱 Dodo, 🏻🖐😩 pointing 👉 to 🚊 Alice with 👉 one 💪🎮 finger; 🖕 
and ➡ the 👆🏻 whole ⌚ party 😛😍🥰 at 👩 once 👮 crowded 🌎 round ⭕⚪⚫ her, 💇💅💆 calling 📲 out 🏎🏍 in ☝ a 🗡 confused 🤷 
way, 👉 'Prizes! 🏅 Prizes!' 🏅 

Alice had 🈶 no ❌ idea 🤔 what 🤷 to 💦 do, 😣 and 😾👉👌 in ☝ despair 👍💓 she ♀ put 😏 her 💪 hand 😳🤚 in 🐭 her 💋

a-piece all 👨 round. 🔁 

'But 🍑 she 🐰🍆 must 🔒 have 😋🚟 a 👌 prize 🏆🥇🎖 herself, 👩👊😭 you 😭 know,' 💭 said 🤭 the 📐 Mouse. 🐀 

'Of 😩👉 course,' 😂 the 🤔 Dodo 🏻🖐😩 replied 😎 very 😲❗ gravely. 'What 😅 else 😱👹 have 😪 you 🙂😍🙃 got 🙋🏼 in 👏 
your 😌 pocket?' 👖 he 👱🏽 went 👏 on, 🔛 turning 🔄 to 😂🅱 Alice. 

'Only 🤔 a 🚗 thimble,' said 🤪 Alice sadly. 😖 

'Hand 👍 it 🤖 over 🏠 here,' 👏 said 😃😀👩 the 👕 Dodo. 🏻🖐😩 

Then 😈🕛🔙 they 😡🤬 all 🥜 crowded 🌎 round ⭕⚪⚫ her 💦 once 👮 more, 💂 while 🕗 the 🐆🦓🦒 Dodo 🏻🖐😩 solemnly 
presented the 🕡🕜 thimble, saying 🗣 'We ❄ beg 😩 your 👩 acceptance of 🔺 this 👆 elegant 😍😋👌 
thimble'; and, 😤 when ☺😋 it 💯 had 😅🔫 finished 👅 this 🙅🏽 short 👌🍆 speech, ✔ they 🤓 all 💯 cheered. 

Alice thought 💭 the 😷 whole 💊👨 thing 😺 very ✅ absurd, 🤪 but 👏 they 🤗 all 😳 looked 👀👅 so 💯 grave 🗡⚰ 
that 🐧 she 👵👩 did 🏢👨 not ☄ dare 🚫💦 to 🗣 laugh; 😄😂 and, ➡ as 🅰 she 👶👧 could 💖❌ not 🙅 think 🤔 of 😑 anything 👱🏻 
to 👁 say, 🗣 she 😍🍆💦 simply 😡 bowed, and 🍒 took 👫 the 😱 thimble, looking 👀 as 🍑 solemn as 😍 she 😡 
could. 🤔 

The 🌃 next ❌ thing ✅ was 🙄 to 🐝 eat 💩 the 😴 comfits: this ⏫ caused some 🌬 noise 🔊 and ➕ 
confusion, 💭 as 🙋 the 😗😂😅 large 🤏 birds 🐦 complained that 😳 they 😡 could 🧐 not 😭 taste 💋 
theirs, and ⚠ the 💡 small 😔 ones 😳 choked and 👶 had 🤲🏻 to 🐯💦♂ be 👎 patted on 🤢🌊 the 👰🤵💍 back. 🔙 
However, 🖐 it 🔎 was 🤲🏻 over 👏 at 🥇 last, 🚶🏽 and 🆒ℹ they 👥 sat 🚌 down 🍑 again 🔜 in 💖💘 a 🎳 ring, 💍 and 😭

'You 👅😱 promised 🙆🏾 to 👏 tell 🉐👨🏾 me 😭 your 🤨 history, 📜 you 👈 know,' 🤓 said 📟🚴🏻 Alice, 'and 👩 why 🤔❓

'Mine 👶🏾 is 😳🙈😍 a 🅰 long 😭 and 💦😫 a 👌 sad 😩😭 tale!' 🍼📕 said 📟🚴🏻 the 🍂✨💚 Mouse, 🐀 turning 🌕 to 🔜 Alice, and 🍆💰

'It 💯 IS 💅🏽 a 📅🤩 long 🕐 tail, 🏃🏻🚨 certainly,' 🔗 said 👏 Alice, looking 👀 down ⬇ with 👏 wonder 🤔 at 🐍

By 😈 this ⬆ time 🕝⏱🕰 she ☄ had 💇🏽 found 🔎 her 💃 way 🧐 into 👨 a 💪 tidy little 👌 room 🏥💋 with ⛽ a 🙅 table 🪑

Alice heard 👂 the 😥 Rabbit 🐇🌰 say, 🗣 'A 🤷 barrowful will 👉 do, 💘 to 🙅😫 begin 🐤🀄 with.' 😲 

'A 👼 barrowful of 🤣 WHAT?' ☝ thought 💭 Alice; but 👏👉 she 💁 had 🤩🎉🎊 not 🚫 long 👋🏻 to 🚊 doubt, 🤷🙍🏻

So 💯 she 👊 swallowed 😫 one ☝ of 🔥 the 🔢💭 cakes, 🎂 and 💩 was 👩🏻👌 delighted to 👂🏼 find 🏃 that 📍 she 🤦

in 🕐 the 👈 middle, 🎯 being 👏 held 👭 up 🆙 by 🍑🙌 two ✌🏻 guinea-pigs, who 💁 were 🌎 giving 😈 it 💏 
something 🏻💪🤴 out 🤤 of 👨 a 🤠 bottle. 🍾 They 🙎👥 all 💯 made 👉 a 🤩 rush 🅱 at 😮 Alice the 🎷🎺 moment 😔 she 👵👱

'The 🤮 first 🍆🍑💦 thing 😏🐱 I've 👨 got 🙏🏻 to 💦 do,' ♦ said 👩🏽 Alice to ‼ herself, 👩👊😭 as 👨 she 👩👱 wandered

An ✅ enormous 🗺 puppy was 🥺 looking 👀 down ⬇ at 🤭 her 👩🏾 with 💕💦 large 👀 round 🔁 eyes, 👀 and ➕❗

Hardly 👄 knowing 😶 what 😅 she 👱 did, 🏢👨 she 🐰😍❤ picked 🆙 up 😎 a 🔪🙅👶 little 🦝 bit 😵🐕 of 😂 stick, 🤦🏻 and 🔻

its 💦 tongue 😋 hanging 🤸 out 😯 of 👍👨 its ⛑ mouth, 💋 and ➕ its 🇮🇹 great 🤗 eyes 👀 half 🏉 shut. 🤫🤭 

This 👈 seemed 🚹🚤 to 👏 Alice a 🍆😂🍌 good 👌 opportunity for 🍼🍭 making 👶🏽 her 👩 escape; 🚶 so 💯 she 💇

'And 💦 yet 😏 what 😅 a 💪 dear 🙌 little 👌 puppy it 💏 was!' 🔚 said 👩🏽 Alice, as 🍑 she 👩🏻 leant

CHAPTER V. 🅱 Advice 😍 from 🔙 a 🅰 Caterpillar 

The 👏 Caterpillar and 🍵 Alice looked 👀👅 at 🤏 each 🏳 other 👪 for 🅱 some 🥳 time 😂👏🤣 in 🥵 silence: 🙊

'Who 💁 are 👍 YOU?' 🤯 said 👱🏿💬 the 🤔 Caterpillar. 

This 👈 was 👀 not 🚫 an ✅ encouraging 👏 opening for 🍆 a 🕸 conversation. 🗣👄 Alice replied, 👉🏾

'I'm 🙋🏼 afraid 😱 I 💶😰 can't 👎🔞🙅 put 😳 it 🙋🏻 more 😬 clearly,' 📺 Alice replied 👉🏾 very 👌✅ politely,

'Are 👍 you 👈 content 👌 now?' 🧐 said 💬😍 the ☔ Caterpillar. 

'Well, 😃 I 🚜 should 💘💊👑 like 😄 to 👂🏼 be 🐝 a 🌎 LITTLE 🦝 larger, sir, ✋👏 if 👏 you 😤🤮 wouldn't 🙅 mind,' 👉

'But 🤭👆 I'm 🙋🏼 not 🚫❗ used ✋♎ to 🤟 it!' 🦚🌊💚 pleaded poor 😥 Alice in 😙 a 💯 piteous tone. 🔉 And 🏄

'You'll ♥ get 😮 used ✋♎ to 🚫 it 💥 in 👻 time,' 🕋🕌👏 said 💬👱🛂 the 👏 Caterpillar; and 👳 it 💡✊ put 😣 the 👏

This ❌🙅😯 time ⏰ Alice waited patiently until 🐈 it 💋 chose 🎭 to 😡 speak 🇯🇵 again. 🙈😩💦 In 🔥

'One ✨ side 😳 will 👀 make 👊🏽 you 😳 grow ❌🛌 taller, 😚 and 🚣 the 👉 other 🤣 side 💕😌👫 will 🈶 make 🤗 you 🤙

CHAPTER VI. Pig 🐖 and 👉 Pepper 😒 

For 🏳 a 😭 minute 🕰 or 💁 two ✌ she 👊 stood looking 👀 at 🐍 the 😈 house, 🏡 and 🤡 wondering what 🤷 
to 👏🏼 do 👌 next, 😔 when 🔜 suddenly 🚼 a 👌 footman in 👏 livery came 💦 running 🏃 out 🏎🏍 of 🤒 the 🕡🕜

otherwise, 💯 judging 🔨 by 👋 his 💦 face 👱 only, 🕦 she 👵👱 would 🅱 have 👍 called 🤳📞📲 him 👴 a 🅰 
fish)--and rapped loudly 👏🏿 at 🍆 the 😁 door 🚪 with 🅰 his 🦊😤😠 knuckles. ❌ It 🥺🥴 was 🉑 opened 🆙 
by 📝 another 😜 footman in 🙋 livery, with 🅰 a 🅰 round 🔁 face, 🙂 and 😱 large 💰 eyes 🍢💑 like 😄 a 🤷

and ➕ crept a 🕺 little 👌 way 👉 out 🙅 of 🔎 the 🖕 wood 🌳 to 🐰👚 listen. 👂🔉 

The 🧼 Fish-Footman began 📇👂🏼 by 🍑🙌 producing 🤷 from 🕐 under ❌ his 👪 arm 💪 a ⬇ great 🆘 letter, ✉ 
nearly 👣 as 🍑 large ⛳ as 🍑 himself, 🤖 and 👶 this 👈 he 👨 handed over 🚦 to 💦 the 😈 other, 👨

Then 🔄 they 👼 both 🌜 bowed low, 👏🏻 and 👩 their ✅ curls got 🙅🏾 entangled together. 😍😘 

Alice laughed 😂😄 so 💯 much 😎 at 🔝 this, 👧⬆🐴 that 🦃 she 👀 had 💋 to ✌ run 🏃🏻 back 🤬🔪 into 🛁🙌🏼 the 💦

The 🌊 Footman seemed 🍉👼🏿 to 😵 think 🧠 this ⬆ a 🅰 good 👌 opportunity for 💸 repeating his 💯

'Come, 💦 it's 🕓 pleased 😚💦 so 💯 far,' 😦 thought 💭 Alice, and 🅱 she 👊 went 🏃 on. 👽 'Would 😾 you 👉

'That 🔙 depends a 👅💦🍆 good 👌 deal 🚫 on ➡ where 🤷🤔😾 you 👩 want 👅💦 to 💦 get 🉐 to,' 🔟 said 👆 the ❄ Cat. 🐈🐱 

'I 👨 don't ❌ much ✌ care 🙈🙉🙊 where--' 🗺 said 💬👱🏿 Alice. 

'Then 👱🏿🙈 it 😡 doesn't 👎 matter ✊🏾🏿 which 🧙 way 💫 you 🖕🏻 go,' 🚶 said 🗣 the 👏 Cat. 😼 

'--so 💯 long ⏳ as 🧐 I 👁 get 🉐 SOMEWHERE,' Alice added 👏 as 🅰 an 🤬 explanation. 

'Oh, 🙈 you're 💀 sure 😀 to 💦 do 🛠👁 that,' 👨🏻 said 💁🏿 the 👨🏾 Cat, 👌👀 'if 🎅 you 🧑🏻 only 🤔 walk 🚶🏼🏃 long 👋🏻

'What 🤔 sort of 💦 people 🗑 live 💪 about ❓ here?' 🐰🇪🇸 

'In 🤒 THAT 👌 direction,' ☝ the 👏 Cat 🐈 said, 🏿🤲👐 waving its 💋 right 👌 paw 🐾 round, 🔁 'lives 📴

'I 🤪🔥😗 suppose so,' 🆗 said 💬 Alice. 

'Well, 🦠😷🤒 then,' 👮 the 😴 Cat 😂 went 🚗 on, 🔛 'you 👇 see, 😨😱 a 🚗 dog 👌 growls when ⏰ it's 🇮🇹 angry, 😠

CHAPTER VII. A 🦶🏻 Mad 😠🤬😡 Tea-Party 

There 👌 was ❓📕📉 a 🅰 table 📲⛩ set 📐 out 🌳 under ❌ a 🤰 tree 🎄 in ❤ front 🔝 of 🍢🔺🔨 the 🎁👏 house, 🏠 and 🇺🇦 the 👌 
March Hare and 🥈 the 👏 Hatter were 👶 having 👧 tea ☕ at 🍆 it: 🧠 a 😂 Dormouse was 👏 sitting ⬇ 
between 👏🏾 them, ☝ fast 🏃 asleep, 😴 and ➕ the 😳 other 👨 two ✌ were 😣 using 😱 it 🤭 as 👂🖕 a 🚗 
cushion, resting their 🤪 elbows on 🔛 it, 💯 and 👏 talking 💬 over 😒 its 🥴 head. 😎 'Very 👌💁 
uncomfortable 😖 for 😬 the ⬇ Dormouse,' thought 💭 Alice; 'only, 🕐 as 😎 it's 🥚💐🐰 asleep, 🏳 I 💁🏻💕 
suppose it 🍆😔😎 doesn't ❌ mind.' 💪 

The 🗿 table 🪑 was 💦 a 🤦 large 🍆 one, 🕐🏅 but ◼ the 🐎 three 👨 were 👶 all 👉🏽🏦 crowded 😞 together 💪💦 at 💯🍆 
one 😠 corner ➡ of 🏻👈👉 it: 🙃 'No 🙅 room! 🛌🏠 No 🚫 room!' 🏠 they 👉 cried 😫 out 🤬 when ⏰ they 👨 saw 👁 Alice

down 🎅🏿 in 👏 a 🅱 large 🤏 arm-chair at 🍆 one 💪🎮 end 🔚 of 🏠 the 🚔 table. 🪑 

'Have 👉 some 🦶 wine,' 🍷 the 🎥 March Hare said 🗣 in 🏊 an 🏳 encouraging 👏 tone. 👌 

Alice looked 👀 all 🙂☺😊 round ⭕⚪⚫ the 🕒 table, 🪑 but 🍑❓ there 🔫 was 👏 nothing 😤👀 on ✅ it 📝 but 👧🏼 tea. 😍🍵 
'I 👤 don't 🚫 see 👁👏 any 🙅🏼 wine,' 🚓 she 😡 remarked. 

'There 👉 isn't 🙅🚫 any,' 🙅 said 🗣 the 🌌🌠 March Hare. 

'Then 👉 it 🤲🖐 wasn't ❌🙅 very ⚖ civil of 👏 you 🤡 to 📝 offer 💸 it,' 😒 said 🗣 Alice angrily. 

'It ❌ wasn't ❌ very 🏽⚖ civil of 💦 you 👉🏻👤 to 🙄 sit 💺 down 🔻 without ❌😖 being 👏 invited,' said 💬😍 
the 👥 March Hare. 

'I 😳 didn't 🚫 know 😭 it 😡 was 👍 YOUR 🖕 table,' 🪑 said 🗣 Alice; 'it's 👹 laid 🍆🍑💦 for 🍆 a 🎮 great 👍 
many 🌍🌄🛶 more 😭😂😁 than 👸🏻 three.' ✊ 

'Your 🩸 hair 🙆 wants 🤲🏻 cutting,' 😂 said 💬 the 😷 Hatter. He 👉😎 had 🙅🏼 been 👇🏾💪 looking 👀 at 🌚😴 Alice 
for 🏳 some 💏 time ⌚ with 😨 great 😁👍 curiosity, and 🎳🌍 this ☝🏼 was 👏 his ❤ first 🥇 speech. ❄ 

'You 👵 should 😏🧐 learn 👨 not 🚫 to 💯🔥🐛 make 🔨 personal ❤ remarks,' Alice said 🗣 with 👏 some 🌬 
severity; 'it's ❎ very ✅ rude.' 🥱🖕🏻 

The ✒ Hatter opened 😅💃🏿 his 🐃 eyes 👀 very 🏽 wide ➡ on 🔛 hearing 👂 this; ⬆ but ‼ all 🙍🏻 he 👦 SAID 🗣 
was, 🥀🚼 'Why 🤔 is 🏡 a 🚗 raven like 🍜🦇👀 a 😆 writing-desk?' 

'Come, ☺ we 😎 shall 👐 have 😁 some 😋 fun 😉😜🌺 now!' 🍑👋 thought 🧠💭 Alice. 'I'm 🏻👨👈 glad they've

'Do 👚👈🏻 you 👈 mean 👩🏿 that 👩 you 🧠 think 🤔 you 💁✨ can 👗 find 📇 out 🏎🏍 the 👉 answer 🤤 to ✌ it?' 💯 said 🏿🤲👐 the 😤 
March Hare. 

'Exactly 📍 so,' 😐 said 💬 Alice. 

'Then 😂 you 👉🏻 should 👋🏻 say 💬 what ❔🏫 you 📢🏃👆 mean,' 😏 the 👏 March Hare went 🏠 on. 🔛 

'I 👁 do,' 💴🚍🈵 Alice hastily replied; 😎 'at 👩 least--at least 💯🔥 I ℹ mean 🤷 what 👏🏻 I 👁

'Not ❌ the 🍃 same 😩 thing 😈 a 😦 bit!' 💓✨🧚 said 🗣👂🏾 the 🆘 Hatter. 'You 😫 might 🔍 just 👌👍 as 🧐 well 😤😯 say 🗣

'You 👨🏻 might 💪 just 🕺 as 🍑 well 👫 say,' 🗣 added 👏 the 🐫😜 March Hare, 'that ☝ "I 👁 like ♐ what ❔🏫 I 👧

'You 😘😍🙏 might 👀 just 👆 as 🔋 well 🤷 say,' 😣 added 👏 the 🐦🐥 Dormouse, who 💁 seemed 😡😠 to 👉🏿👴 be 🚫🍖

'It 😌 IS 🈶 the 😢 same 🕦 thing 🐘 with 💪 you,' 🤮 said 🗣 the 🤙🏼 Hatter, and 😫😲 here 👏 the 😂 
conversation 👩🏽 dropped, ⬇ and 👏💰😦 the 🍝 party 😛😍🥰 sat 🚌 silent 🤫 for 🅱 a 🤡 minute, ⏰ while 👉🏻 Alice 
thought 💭 over 😳🙊💦 all 💯 she 🅰 could 🧐 remember 🧠 about 🚰 ravens and 👏 writing-desks, 
which 👏 wasn't ❌ much. 😂 

The 🌍 Hatter was ✅ the 🍝🆎💭 first 🥇 to 🔓💦 break 💔 the 🥒 silence. 🙊 'What 💀 day ☀ of 🥰 the 😈 month 😍 
is 🛑 it?' 😀😃😄 he 🤴🏻 said, 🙈 turning 🌕 to 🅱 Alice: he 👨 had 👎 taken 👊 his 😈😘 watch 📞 out ✅😜🦠 of 🔎 his 😈 
pocket, 👖 and 👍 was 🎼 looking 👀 at 👩 it 🤫🔪 uneasily, shaking 😲 it 🇮🇹 every 👏 now 👑 and 💪 then, 😠💯⏱ 
and 💓 holding 🚪 it 🍆 to 📝 his 💦 ear. 👂🤫 

Alice considered 🤔 a 💩🤢 little, 👌 and 👏 then ⏪ said 👱🏿💬 'The 💡 fourth.' 

'Two ✌ days 📆 wrong!' 👺 sighed the 🚓🚔 Hatter. 'I 🤗 told 💬 you 🙍🏻 butter 🦋 wouldn't 👎🏻😤 suit

'It 😩😳💦 was 👏 the 👞 BEST 😎😤 butter,' 🦋 the 👴🏿 March Hare meekly replied. 👉🏾 

'Yes, ✅ but 🍑 some ✈ crumbs must 😏 have ⁉ got 😦 in 🥵 as 🗻 well,' 💯‼ the 👏 Hatter grumbled: 
'you 😀 shouldn't have 🤔 put 👏🏾 it 🍆💦 in 😆 with 📆 the 💁 bread-knife.' 

The 🍉 March Hare took 👫 the 👉🤘👮 watch 🚱 and ☄ looked 👀 at ❗ it 💯 gloomily: then 🤕 he ❌ dipped

Alice had 🈶 been 🗿 looking 👀 over 📄 his 😉 shoulder with 👏 some 🍞 curiosity. 'What 😵 a ✨

'Why 🤔 should 🚫 it?' 💯 muttered the 🌠 Hatter. 'Does 🏋 YOUR 👽 watch 🙄 tell 🗣 you 🍑😫 what 👏

'Of 👉 course 🤗 not,' ❌ Alice replied 👉🏾 very 🥰 readily: 'but ◼ that's ✔ because 💥 it 🧐

'Which 🤩🤪 is 👏 just 👌 the 🧐 case 🤞🏻 with 👏 MINE,' 💝 said 😃😀👩 the 👻 Hatter. 

Alice felt 🍞😎😨 dreadfully puzzled. The 🇺🇸 Hatter's remark 📣 seemed 🍉👼🏿 to 🔥 have 😂💩 no ❌

'The 🤡 Dormouse is 💪 asleep 🛌😴 again,' 🔃 said 🗣 the 👄 Hatter, and 👏 he 👨 poured a 🍆💦 little 🐥

The 👏 Dormouse shook 😳 its 😫 head 💆 impatiently, and 😱 said, 💬👱🏿 without 🙅🏼 opening its 📍

He 🧔🏾 moved 📦 on 🔛 as 💰😴 he 👨🏻😧 spoke, 🗣🙅♂ and 💦 the 🏙 Dormouse followed 🚓 him: 💬😂💕 the 💯 March Hare 
moved 📦 into 👀 the 👏 Dormouse's place, 👨 and 🌏 Alice rather 😮💭 unwillingly took 👫 
the 🇺🇸 place 😫🤮 of ◽ the 👦🚟 March Hare. The 🅱 Hatter was ✅ the 💩 only 👏 one ☝ who 🍑👀 got 😎 any 😂😅

This ⬆ answer 🤤 so 💯 confused 🤷 poor 😔 Alice, that 🤔 she 👩 let 🌸 the 🍆🧀 Dormouse go 🆗 on ➡ for ➡

'They 🤗👨 were 👶 learning to ➡ draw,' ✏ the 🔳 Dormouse went 🚶🏻 on, ☝😡 yawning and 👏 rubbing 🔸🔬

This 😞⁉ piece 🍰 of 💦 rudeness was 🙁 more ➕ than 🥺 Alice could 🌲🍁 bear: 🐻 she ☄ got ✊🏾 up 😍 in 👏

'Are 💯 their 🍏 heads 😂 off?' 💦😝😂 shouted the 🌃 Queen. 👩

'That's 👠 right!' 👌 shouted the 🧠 Queen. 👸 'Can ❓ you 👏🏾✊ play 🎽 croquet?'

'Yes!' 👍😅 shouted Alice. 

'Come 😩👌🏼 on, 🔛 then!' 😮 roared the 😷 Queen, 👩 and 👱 Alice joined 🤩 the 🌌 procession,

'It's--it's a ⚽🎾⚾ very 😔♀ fine 👌 day!' 🇪🇸 said 🗣 a 🔥 timid voice 🗣 at 📍 her 😡😨 side. 🔛 She 👧 was 🔛

'Very,' ♀ said 🗣👂🏾 Alice: '--where's 🇩🇪🤔 the 👏 Duchess?' 

'Hush! 😝🤐 Hush!' 😝🤐 said 💬🙈 the 🤔 Rabbit 🐰🤤🍆 in 💦 a 😾🅰 low, 🔉 hurried tone. 👌 He 😎 looked 👀

"What 🤷 for?"' 👏 

'She 🙋🏻 boxed the 👉 Queen's 💅💋 ears--' 👂 the 🧐 Rabbit 😈😳 began. 🔘 Alice gave 🙏🏿 a 🅰 little 🍑

'Get 🉐 to 💃 your 😠 places!' 🖐 shouted the 💃🏼 Queen 👸 in 👅💦 a 🚗 voice 🐸 of ♦ thunder, 🌩 and 🤡

began. 🔘 Alice thought 💭 she 👩 had 🈶 never 🚫 seen 👀 such 😝 a 🙊 curious 🆚🚴🏿 croquet-ground in 👼 
her 😩 life; 🧬 it 🕳 was 👏 all 😋 ridges 🤤 and 🌏 furrows; the 🤴🐷 balls ⚪ were 👌 live 🐛 hedgehogs,

up 👆 and 🍒 to 🍆💦 stand 🦵💪✊ on 🔛 their 🧐 hands 👊💦 and 👨 feet, 🔲 to 👀 make 😲 the 🍑 arches. 

The 🧼 chief 😍 difficulty Alice found 👀👈 at 👉✋🍋 first 🥇 was 😎 in 🤫 managing her 🍆 flamingo: 
she 👩🏾 succeeded in 🔜 getting 😫💦 its 🇮🇹 body 🚶 tucked away, 😋 comfortably 🙇🏻 enough, 🥴 under ⬇ 
her 💋 arm, 🤳 with ❓🏂🔵 its 🍆 legs 🤸 hanging 🤸 down, ⬇ but ‼ generally, just 🤤 as 💪🏼 she 👊 had 👬 got 👍 
its 🕛 neck 👔 nicely 👍 straightened out, 🤬 and 👏 was 🚫 going ✈ to ☝ give 🤲🏻 the 🙃 hedgehog 🦔 a 🅰

laughing: 😫 and 😉👝 when 🕞❓ she 💞 had 🈶 got 😳 its 😦 head 💀 down, ⬇ and ➕ was ✅✔ going 👉 to 📮 begin ✊👌 
again, 🗣 it 🇮🇹 was 🔚 very 💎 provoking to 🗣 find 📇 that 🆔 the 💯 hedgehog 🦔 had 🈶 unrolled

generally a 😭🌊💯 ridge or 😐 furrow in 💦 the 🤔 way ↕ wherever she 👱 wanted 😍 to 🙊 send 💌 the 👐 
hedgehog 🦔 to, 😶 and, 🦾 as 🅰 the 🎵ℹ doubled-up soldiers were 😣 always 🕔 getting 👉🏻 up ☝ 
and 🍙👏 walking 🚶 off 🤤 to 💦 other ⬆ parts 🍆 of ◽ the 🎆 ground, 👍🛬 Alice soon 🔛▶ came 🐍🍆 to 😴 the 😂 
conclusion 🤪 that 🏻⚪ it 🤩 was ⏮ a 💦👌 very 💎 difficult 😡 game 🎱 indeed. 💯😂 

The ⬇ players 🙆 all 🌎 played 🕺 at ❗ once ☝ without 💯 waiting 🕚🕕🕠 for 🍆 turns, 🔄 quarrelling 
all 🤷 the 🚗 while, 🕗 and 🅱 fighting 👊 for 😡 the 🅱 hedgehogs; and 👏 in 😌 a 🤠 very 🍀❗ short 👌🍆

shouting 😱 'Off 📴 with 🍋 his 👒 head!' 😫🍆💦 or 👹 'Off 📴 with 🙅 her 👱 head!' 👤 about 💦 once 👮 in 😤 a 🚗

Alice began 📇👂🏼 to 💦 feel 🖤 very 👌 uneasy: to 🐷 be 📖 sure, ☝ she ☄ had 🚯➿🅾 not 🚫⛔ as 🌈 yet 😁😎 had 🈶 any 🆘

She 👩 was 👏 looking 👀 about 😤 for 👉 some 📊 way 🤢🤮☣ of 🎆 escape, 🚶 and 🍯 wondering whether 💮 she 👱

a 🤪 minute ⏰ or ➕ two, ✌🏻 she 👵🏾 made 😖 it 💯 out 🤜💡 to 👏 be 👀 a 💪 grin, 😏😈 and 😱 she ♀👩 said 🛸🚶🏿 to 📝 herself 🤷 
'It's 😜😂 the 🦠 Cheshire Cat: 😼 now 🤔 I 👧 shall 👐 have 😂 somebody 👥 to 🧠 talk 🗣 to.' 🎴 

'How 🤔 are 🙄 you 👈 getting 😫💦 on?' 💣 said 👋 the ✌ Cat, 🐱😹😻 as 💯 soon 🔜 as 🧐 there 👌 was 📈🔜📉 mouth 😮

'I 😬😩 don't 😬 think 🤔 they 👥 play 🎮 at 👐 all 👨🏿🏽 fairly,' Alice began, 🔘 in 🔥 rather 🤷 a 👌

'How ✋🏾 do 👏 you 👆 like 😄 the ⚡❄ Queen?' 👸 said 💬😍 the 👦🏻♏ Cat 🙀😵😻 in 👏 a 🥱 low 👇 voice. 🔊 

'Not 🙅🏼 at ☮ all,' 💯 said 👱🏿💬 Alice: 'she's 👉 so 💯 extremely--' 😠 Just 💩 then 🔜 she 🐰💦😍 noticed 🎶😮🅿

'--likely 🤷 to 🚶🏻 win, 🥇🏆🎖 that 👵🌽 it's 🅰 hardly 👄 worth 🌐 while 🕗 finishing the 👏 game.' 👾 

The 🦊😛🗿 Queen 👸🏿 smiled 😌 and 💦 passed ✅ on. 🔛 

'Who 💁 ARE 🟢 you 💔 talking 🙊 to?' ❌ said 🗣 the 🌎☝ King, 🤴 going 🍏 up 🙆🏻 to 😩 Alice, and 🅰 looking 👀

'It's 👹 a 😯💰 friend 🙋 of 🙏 mine--a Cheshire Cat,' 😿 said 👱🏿💬 Alice: 'allow ☁♠ me 🅰 to 😫

'I 👀 don't 🚫 like ✝ the 🐦 look 😏 of 🏻👋👉 it 🎯🔫 at 👩 all,' 🐵✊🏿 said 👱🏿💬 the 👏 King: 👑 'however, 🖐💯 it 🔨⛏ may ☀

'I'd 🆔 rather 📯💅🏾 not,' 🙈 the 😂 Cat 🐱 remarked. 

'Don't 🚫 be 🐝 impertinent,' said 💬 the 👏 King, 👑❓ 'and 👏 don't 🚫 look 👀 at 😮 me 👩 like 🤑😏😁 that!' 👉 
He 🦹🏼 got ‼ behind ↩ Alice as 👌🅱 he 😁 spoke. 🗣🙅♂

'Well, 😤😯 it 💯 must 💯 be 🐝 removed,' 🚫 said 🗣 the 🚴 King ⚠ very 👍 decidedly, and 😏 he 🏇🏼 called 🗣🦶

The 😩 Queen 👑🌸❤ had 😎 only 👌 one ☝ way ↕ of 🍢🔺🔨 settling all 👮 difficulties, great 🇬🇧 or 💁 small. 🇯🇵 
'Off 📴 with 👏 his 🎡 head!' 👱 she 😩🤣😘 said, 💬😍 without ❌ even ⬇ looking 👀 round. ⭕⚪⚫ 

'I'll 😁 fetch the ⏳ executioner 😤 myself,' 🙋 said 🙈 the 💩🔑 King 🤴 eagerly, 🎸😣💃 and ➕ he 🦊😡👺 
hurried off. 🙅 

Alice thought 🧠 she 👧▶ might 💪 as 🧐 well 🙏🏼 go 🧼😝👊 back, 👈 and 😑 see 👀 how 🤔 the 🐫😜 game 😳 was 👏 going 🏃 
on, ⤵ as 👉🏻 she 😙😚 heard 👂💌 the 🧼 Queen's 💅🏼💋 voice 🐸 in 🏥🍲🏼 the 👐 distance, 🚫🤦 screaming 😱 with 👉

executed for 🔜 having 👬 missed 🚫🎯 their 🙏🏿🏃 turns, 🔁 and 💕 she 👩🏾 did 😌 not 🚫 like 💖 the 👸 look 👀

whether 💮 it 💯 was ☝🏼 her ♓ turn 🔃 or 👸🏽 not. 😤 So 🙇 she 😩🤣😘 went 🆔 in ⬇ search 🔎 of 💦 her 💖 hedgehog. 🦔 

The 👅 hedgehog 🦔 was ◾ engaged in 👉🏻 a 🕦 fight 👊 with 👨🏿😣 another ➿ hedgehog, 🦔 which 🧙 seemed 🤔 
to 😂 Alice an 😍🌵 excellent 💡 opportunity for 🍆 croqueting one 😄☝ of 💦 them 🏃 with 🥦 the 👏

By 👀 the 📎 time 🕖🕗🕘 she 🐰😍❤ had 🙅🏼 caught 👀 the 😈 flamingo and ▶ brought 🤑 it 😛😝🍦 back, 🔙 the 🧼 fight 👊⚔

escape 🚶 again, ❌😬 and 🇪🇺 went 🏃 back 🔙 for 😣 a 😍 little 👌😩😤 more 📈 conversation 🗣👄 with 🤟 her 🙎👞

When ⏰ she 👱 got 👦🙋 back 🔙 to 👐 the 👏 Cheshire Cat, 😼🐈 she 😊 was 🎷 surprised 😱 to 😤 find 🕵 quite ✅ a 🍆 
large 👀 crowd 👨 collected round ⭕⚪⚫ it: 👏 there 🤠💝 was 💦😉🙃 a 🚬 dispute going 😂 on 💦 between 👏🏾

while 😉 all 👷🏾💃 the 👩 rest 😪 were 😖 quite ✅ silent, 🤡🔫😂 and 😛 looked 💥 very 🎲 uncomfortable. 😣😖 

The 🕡🕜 moment 😎 Alice appeared, 💢 she 🙏🏻 was 👩🏻👌 appealed to 🤡 by 📝 all 🏃👌 three 👨 to 🐩 settle

all 🤷 spoke 🗣🙅♂ at 👌🍆😏 once, ☝🏻 she 👱 found 🔎 it 🍆💦♥ very ⚖ hard 💎 indeed 😂 to 🗣 make 🅰 out 👩🏻 exactly 😉 
what 🦶 they ☮ said. 🗣 

The 😫 executioner's argument 🗣 was, 👏 that ⁉ you 👤 couldn't 🙄 cut 🔪 off 😂 a 🅰 head 🗣 unless 😳🙄🤔 
there ✔ was 👏 a 👌 body 🚶 to 💦 cut ✂ it ♻ off 👊 from: 😈😡😋 that 😳 he 👨 had 🈶 never ❌ had 🤩🎉🎊 to 😐 do 🅱 such 👪 a 👈😎

The ⬇ King's 👑 argument 🗣 was, 👏 that 👀 anything 🤷 that 😀 had 🤲🏻 a 💯 head 👨 could 🤔 be 🈸👚📟 
beheaded, 😵 and 👏😤👅 that 🤏🏻👩 you 😎 weren't to 🚟❗ talk 📢🗣 nonsense. 🙄🙃🤪 

The 👉 Queen's 💅🏼💋 argument 🗣 was, 🔛 that 🏿👏☝ if 🕵 something 💥 wasn't ❌🙅 done 🙅 about 😤 it 🙄 in ➡🚪 less ➖ 
than 😳 no ❌ time 🕰 she'd 🏡 have 👊 everybody 🌎 executed, all 😫 round. ⭕⚪⚫ (It 🖐🛑 was ⬇ this 😩💦 last 🗣 
remark 📣 that 👨 had 🅰 made 👒 the 🍝 whole ✋🤚 party 🎉 look ⬇ so 💯 grave 🗡⚰ and 😉👝 anxious.) 

Alice could 🔒 think 🙇🏻 of 💦 nothing 🚫 else 🤪 to 😤 say 🗣 but 🤪 'It 🍆😔😎 belongs to 👄 the 🌀 Duchess:

'She's ♀ in 🤚 prison,' 🏗🗺 the 👐🏽 Queen 👸 said 💬😍 to 💦 the 🏃 executioner: 😤 'fetch her 🎉👸💯 here.' 🥂🎇 
And ⛳ the 👃 executioner 😤 went 🚶🏻 off 😁👍 like 👉 an 😍🌵 arrow. 💘 

The 👐 Cat's 😹 head 😑 began 🎼 fading 🙅🏼 away 🗑 the 😡 moment 😎 he 🦸🏻 was 😡😠😤 gone, 👋🏻😔 and, 😐 
by 😈👷 the 🌍 time ⏰ he 👱 had 🈶 come 👈 back 👩 with 😉 the 🌌 Duchess, it 💡✊ had 🈶 entirely

looking 👀 for 👰 it, 🍆 while 👉🏻 the 🧼 rest 😪 of 😱😩 the 👜🎒😍 party 🎉 went 👏 back ⬅ to 💦 the 🚪 game. 🏓

'You 👇 can't 🙅 think ♋ how 🤔 glad I 😳 am 😏 to 👲🏼 see 👀 you 👨 again, 🚀👂🏿 you 👀 dear 🙌 old 👴 thing!' 👊🏼 
said 💬😍 the 🌛 Duchess, as 🍑 she 👊 tucked her 📱 arm 👌💪 affectionately into 📐 Alice's, and 🍆💰 
they 👨 walked 🚷 off 📴 together. 👥 

Alice was 👏 very ⚖ glad to 😵 find 🔎 her 👩🏾 in 🍥 such 😲🤤😢 a 🚗 pleasant temper, 😞 and 😳 thought 🧠 
to 💦 herself 👩👊😭 that 🔢 perhaps 💯 it 🙅⛔🤔 was 👎 only 💫 the 👏 pepper 😂 that ⁉ had 🈶 made 👏 her 👬 so 💯

'When 🔜 I'M 😚 a 🍆 Duchess,' she ☄ said 💬👱🏿 to 🅱 herself, 🤷 (not 🚫 in 👏 a 😯 very 💎📈 hopeful tone 🔉

She 👩👱 had 🚯➿🅾 quite ✅ forgotten 💯😫😭 the 👗 Duchess by 😈👷 this ⬇ time, ⏰ and 👑 was 👷🌐👔 a 👌🏻 little 👀👄👅

'Tut, tut, child!' 👦 said 💬👱🏿 the 🕡🕜 Duchess. 'Everything's got 🏼👲🙍 a 👏 moral, if 💯👏 only 🤠

Alice did 🏢👨 not 😨 much ⚠ like 👅💦 keeping 👍 so 🆘 close 👨 to 🔒 her: 👩🏾 first, ☝ because 🧐 the 🗣

in 😩 the 🎷 middle 🖕 of 💰💦 her 💃 favourite ❤🧡💛 word 👏 'moral,' and ➕ the 🤔 arm 💪 that 😯 was 👏 linked 🔗

in ➡ front 🔝 of 🅱 them, ☝ with 👉👌💦 her 🙋 arms 🙌 folded, frowning like 💞 a 💩🌶🍆 thunderstorm. 

'A 😡 fine 💯👌😩 day, 🌞 your 👉 Majesty!' the 🔥 Duchess began 📇👂🏼 in 🥳 a 😫 low, 🔉 weak 😤 voice. 🎤 

'Now, 📍📅 I 👁 give 🤲🏻 you 🆙 fair 😭 warning,' ⚠ shouted the 👏 Queen, 👸 stamping on ☠ the 🔥

The 🛐🌈 Duchess took 👫 her ❌📵 choice, 🤔 and ⚠ was 🥀🚼 gone 🏃 in 🔫 a 😩 moment. 🦍 

'Let's 🎤 go 👱🏻 on 🔛 with 🧐 the 🅱 game,' 🎱 the 👮 Queen 👸 said 🗣 to 💦🏾 Alice; and 🚨 Alice was 👏 
too 😟 much ♥ frightened 😨 to 🚿 say 🗣🙊📢 a 📢 word, 👄🔉 but 🍑 slowly 😍🍝😳 followed 👨🔜🚔 her 🙋🏻 back 🔙 to 😵 the 👏 
croquet-ground. 

The 👏 other 👪 guests had 🈶 taken 💦 advantage 😏🥳 of 👱 the 👐🏽 Queen's 💅💋 absence, and 👏 were 🎊 
resting in 🔥 the 😡 shade: ⛱⛅ however, 🖐 the 👏🏻 moment 😳 they 🤢 saw 👀 her, ♀ they ✊🏽 hurried 
back 🔩 to 💦 the 😈 game, 🕹 the 👄 Queen 👑🌸❤ merely remarking that 😐 a 🍆 moment's 🅱 delay would 🤔 
cost 💸 them 👉 their 🚫 lives. 🤭🎥 

All 💥💉 the 🦊😛🗿 time ⌚ they 👥 were 😂 playing 🎲 the 🍝🆎💭 Queen 👸 never ❌ left ⬅ off 📴 quarrelling with 💕💦

who 💁 of 🔎 course 😂 had 🈶 to ✌ leave 😂 off 📉 being 🐝 arches to 👁 do 💕💬👀 this, 💪😠 so 🆘 that 😍 by 🦄 
the 💪 end 🔚 of 🙆🏼 half 💯 an 👎 hour ⏳⏱🕐 or 😐 so 👏 there 👌 were 😩👉 no 😣 arches left, 👈😡 and 👎👌 all 👈🏻 the 🍆

under ⬇ sentence 👌✏ of 💦 execution. 

Then ➕ the 👉 Queen 👩 left ◀ off, 💎 quite ✅ out 🏎🏍 of 🏻👋👉 breath, 🛩 and 👏 said 🗣 to 🙌 Alice, 'Have 👍

'No,' 🚫 said 💬😍 Alice. 'I 🙋🏻 don't 🚫 even 🤤♀ know 💭 what ⁉ a 🔜🐏 Mock 💁 Turtle is.' 😎 

'It's 📍 the 👏 thing 👏 Mock 💁 Turtle Soup 🥫 is ‼ made 🧬 from,' 😂 said 💬👱🏿 the 🔝⏩🔯 Queen. 👸🏿 

'I 👁 never 🚫 saw 👀 one, 😂🤮💯 or 🤷 heard 👂 of 💦 one,' ☝ said 😃😀👩 Alice. 

'Come 🦵 on, ⬇ then,' 😧👋 said 🤠🗣 the 😂 Queen, 👸🏿 'and 👏 he 🐥 shall 😋 tell 🙊 you 🧍🏻 his 🚗 history,' 🧐🙄 

As 🤪 they 👨 walked 🚷 off 😈 together, 👮 Alice heard 💭 the 🥁 King ⚠ say 🗣 in 😆 a 😭 low 🔉 voice, 🎤 
to ✌ the 🐦 company 🏢👁 generally, 'You 🙍🏼 are 🎀😋 all 👏 pardoned.' 'Come, ✈ THAT'S 😩👉👈 a 🤖😴 good 👌

They 👉 very ☣⚖ soon 🌮🚶🏻 came 👅💦🤤 upon 👦 a 👏 Gryphon, lying 👉 fast 🏃 asleep 😴 in 👃 the 👏 sun. ☀ 
(IF 💯👏 you 👏 don't 🙅 know 🤔 what 🤷 a 🗣 Gryphon is, 🌀 look 😏 at 👌🍆😏 the 👏 picture.) 🖼 'Up, 🔥 lazy 😴

the 😈 Gryphon. Alice did 🙀😳 not ❌ quite 🎩 like ✅ the 👉🏿 look 😶 of 💯 the 👉 creature, but ☝ on ⏸ 
the 🍆 whole 🕳 she 👱 thought ⛽ it 👩 would 🤐 be 🐝 quite 😋 as ☝🏾❓ safe 🔒 to 👁 stay 💆 with 🙀 it 😛😝🍦 as 🍆 to 🆔 go 🚶 
after ➡ that 💁🏼 savage 😂🤣 Queen: 🙏🏻💧 so 🤪 she ☄ waited. 

The 🍆 Gryphon sat 🚌 up ⬆ and 😤 rubbed its 📍 eyes: 👀 then 💢 it 💯 watched 💩 the 👏 Queen 🙏🏻💧 till 🕣 
she ♀👩 was 😞 out ✒ of 😩👉 sight: 👀 then 🔗 it 😌 chuckled. 😆 'What 🐷🤳 fun!' 🥳🎉 said 🗣 the 👏 Gryphon, 
half 🌓 to 💦 itself, 🚝 half 🌓 to 🚩 Alice. 

'What 😅 IS 💦 the 👵🏽 fun?' 😚 said 🗣🗯 Alice. 

'Why, ⁉🤔 SHE,' 🐰💦😍 said 💬😍 the 🍝 Gryphon. 'It's 📍 all ❗ her 🍼 fancy, 💠 that: 😐 they 😤✋ never 🙅 
executes nobody, 🙅 you 🥺💞 know. 🤔 Come 🏃🏻 on!' 🔛 

'Everybody 👨 says 🐀 "come 👈 on!" 😭 here,' 👇 thought 🧠💭 Alice, as 🌈 she 🐴 went 🏠 slowly 😍🍝😳 
after 😧😤😵 it: 👈🏿 'I 👈👩 never ❌ was 👏 so 💯 ordered 📑 about 🔨 in ☝ all 💯🅱👌 my ☝ life, 😵 never!' 🙅 

They 👫 had 🈶 not 🙅🏼 gone 👋🏻😔 far 🗻 before 💦😩👙 they ☀ saw 👀 the 🙏🏻 Mock 💁 Turtle in 🤗 the 🧼 distance, 🚫🤦 
sitting 🧘 sad 😔 and 👏 lonely 😭 on ⬇ a 🚗 little 🤞🏼 ledge 👨 of 💦 rock, 👌😎📢 and, 👉 as 💰😴 they 😡 came 🚶

pitied him 👌 deeply. 💨🌬 'What 😦 is 💦 his 🔝 sorrow?' 😭 she 👱 asked ❓💯👩 the 😮 Gryphon, and 😳 the 😷

So 💯 they 👅 went 👏 up 😐😔 to 👉👌🍆 the ⏩ Mock 💁 Turtle, who 💁 looked 👀 at 👌🍆😏 them 🙉 with 😂 large 🤏 eyes 👀 
full 🌝 of 💦 tears, 😂 but 👧🏼 said 🗣 nothing. 🚫 

'This 🙄 here ↙ young 🧒 lady,' 👩 said 💬 the 👏 Gryphon, 'she ☄ wants 👐 for 🖖🏼 to 💦 know ⛅ your 👱

'I'll 🤢 tell 💬 it 🚗 her,' ❌📵 said 🈴🅾▪ the 🌎 Mock 💁 Turtle in 📥🚮 a 🅰 deep, ⚫ hollow 🤤 tone: 🔉 'sit 💺 
down, ⤵ both 🌜🌛 of ☹ you, 🏻👉🧑 and ✋ don't 😤👊 speak 🗣 a 👉 word 🐒 till 😅😻 I've 🤡 finished.' 💦 

So 💯 they 🦹 sat 🚌 down, ⬇ and 🦾 nobody 🚫 spoke 🗣🙅♂ for 👍 some ✌🏻😎 minutes. 🕑 Alice thought 🤔 to 👃🏿 
herself, 🤷 'I ℹ don't 🙅 see 👀 how 💯 he 🦊🙀 can 👏 EVEN 🙅 finish, 🏁 if 👁 he 👨 doesn't 🙀 begin.' 🍢👂👻 But 😘 
she ☄ waited patiently. 

'Once,' ❗ said 💁🏿 the 😈 Mock 💁 Turtle at 👉✋🍋 last, ↩ with 👨🏿😣 a 🙅 deep 😱 sigh, 😔 'I 👁🙌🏻 was 👏 a 👼 real 💯

These 👽✌ words 📖🙇🏾 were ⚫ followed 🚓 by ❌ a 😍 very 🏽😔 long 🔄 silence, 🤫 broken 💔 only 🤠 by 😈 an ✅ 
occasional 👌🏃 exclamation of 🐷 'Hjckrrh!' from 🔽 the ☁ Gryphon, and 👏 the 🃏 constant 🔆 
heavy 🏋 sobbing 😭 of 💦 the 🧼 Mock 💁 Turtle. Alice was 👍💦 very 👌😲 nearly 🍆 getting 👎 up ⬆ and 🐝🥱

nothing. 🚫 

'When 😖 we 👥 were 🎉 little,' 💃🏼😫 the 🍆 Mock 💁 Turtle went 🍥 on 🔛 at 🍆 last, 🕘 more ⚱ calmly,

'You 🍆💦👆 ought to 💰 be 💦 ashamed 🤐😩 of 🌊 yourself 😱🤫 for 🍆 asking ❔ such 😲🤤😢 a 🚗 simple 🍦 question,' 😩

'I 👧 never ❌ said 🗣🗯 I 👧 didn't!' 👎❌ interrupted Alice. 

'You 😱 did,' ❓ said 🗣 the 🌃 Mock 💁 Turtle. 

'Hold 👫 your 😤 tongue!' 👅 added 👏 the 🙅🏻😠 Gryphon, before 📘📗🤓 Alice could 😷 speak 🗣 again. 😭😬👎 
The 🌀 Mock 💁 Turtle went 🚶🏻 on. 🔛 

'We 🤝 had 💔 the 😡😈 best 👏 of 😖 educations--in fact, 🤔 we 💂 went 🚗 to ✍ school 🏤 every ☝ day--' 📅 

'I'VE 👨 been ✊🏼 to 👏 a 🚗 day-school, too,' 🥰 said 📟🚴🏻 Alice; 'you 🐇 needn't be 🐝 so 👉😲 proud 😤

'With 😳 extras?' 😎💯 asked 😎🧐😏 the 🎁🤤🅱 Mock 💁 Turtle a 🚗 little 🤏🏻 anxiously. 

'Yes,' 🥰 said 👵🏾 Alice, 'we 👫 learned 😌 French and 🧘 music.' 🎶 

'And 👑 washing?' 💦 said 🈴🅾▪ the 🌳 Mock 💁 Turtle. 

'Certainly 🔗 not!' 😠 said 💬👱🏿 Alice indignantly. 

'Ah! 😁 then 👩 yours 😱 wasn't ❌ a 👇⬇ really 😩 good 💦 school,' 🏫 said 👱🏿💬 the 🍆 Mock 💁 Turtle in 👏

'You 🐃👈 couldn't 😞 have 🈶 wanted 👉😄👈 it 🍆 much,' 💪🏻 said 🗣 Alice; 'living 😩 at 👌🍆😏 the 🍳 bottom 👇 of 💜

'I 😋 couldn't 🤷 afford 💵 to 💦🏾 learn 👨 it.' 😛😜 said 🥣 the 🐦🐥 Mock 💁 Turtle with 👏 a 🙇 sigh. 😔 'I 👤

'What 🤔 was ☝🏼 that?' 🤪 inquired Alice. 

'Reeling and 👉🏻 Writhing, of 💦 course, 💯👌👀 to 🍆💦 begin 👊 with,' 🙅😍 the 🗣 Mock 💁 Turtle

'I 👀 never ❌ heard 👂💌 of 🗑 "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to 👷🏿 say. 🗣👶🏽 'What 👏 is 😂 it?' 🎯🔫 

The 👏🅱 Gryphon lifted up 🆙 both ⬅ its 🇮🇹 paws 🐾 in 👻 surprise. 🤨 'What! 😦 Never 🚫 heard 👂 of 🤫

'Well, 🚬 then,' ⏰➡ the 🇺🇸 Gryphon went 🏠 on, 🐆 'if 👀😇👌 you 🍆👉 don't 🚫 know 🤔 what 🙇 to 💦 uglify is, 💦

Alice did 👏 not ❌ feel 👤 encouraged to 🅱 ask 🤔 any 🧘🏿 more 😍🥰🦋 questions about 👉 it, 👩 so 🎆 she 👩 
turned 👭 to 🚟 the 🌹 Mock 💁 Turtle, and ☄ said 🗣 'What 😦 else 😓💗 had 😎 you 👏 to 🐝👀 learn?' 👩🏽 

'Well, 😃 there 👌 was 👏 Mystery,' 💇😕 the 😝 Mock 💁 Turtle replied, 👉🏾 counting 🧐 off 💦😝😂 
the 🅱 subjects on ⏸ his 🦆 flappers, '--Mystery, 💇😕 ancient 🗿 and ➕❗ modern, 😂 with 🕦♓

'Hadn't time,' 🤭 said 👆 the 🇺🇸 Gryphon: 'I 🙏 went 👏 to 💃 the 🤠🦍🕷 Classics master, 💯 though. ❤

'What 🤷 a 👏 curious 🆚🚴🏿 plan!' 📂 exclaimed Alice. 

'That's ✔ the 😷 reason 🤔 they're 😂 called 😂 lessons,' the 🛐🌈 Gryphon remarked:

CHAPTER X. 👰🏻👲 The 🗣 Lobster Quadrille

'Change 📈 lobsters 🦐 again!' 🕣 yelled 🗣 the 🚪⬅ Gryphon at 🌒😟 the 🌌 top 🔝 of 👕 its 🕓 voice. 🗣 

'Back 👃🏾 to 🇨🇳 land ♿ again, 😬 and 😳 that's 👍 all 💯 the 😁 first 🚿 figure,' 😂👌🧔 said 🗣 the ✒ Mock 💁

'Oh, 😳⁉ YOU 👨🏻 sing,' 🎶🎤 said 🗣 the 🐎✊🏿 Gryphon. 'I've 🙋 forgotten 💯😫😭 the 🐦 words.' 🆔

'IT 🇮🇹 DOES ❗ THE 🍆 BOOTS 👢 AND 💰 SHOES.' 👞 the 😂🤣 Gryphon replied 😎 very 👌 solemnly.

'Boots 👢 and 👏 shoes 👟 under ❌ the 👺 sea,' the 👃 Gryphon went 👏 on ⏸ in 👨 a 🅰 deep 😱 voice, 🗣

'If ♨ I'd 🧑🏻 been 🙂💫 the ® whiting,' said 💬👱🏿 Alice, whose thoughts 💭 were 👶 still 👇 running 🏃

CHAPTER XI. Who 💁 Stole 😩 the 😡 Tarts? 

The 👮 King 🤴🏻 and 👏 Queen 👩 of 🐦🐤 Hearts 😘 were 😂 seated 👇 on 🔛 their 🧞 throne 👑🙏😇 when ⌛ they 👲🏻😈 
arrived, 🤡 with ➕ a 🦠 great 😁👍 crowd 👨 assembled about 🤔💭 them--all sorts of 👏 little 👌 
birds 🐓🐦 and ⏬🎅🏻 beasts, 🍆🍑 as 🍑 well 😔 as 🏃🏽😟 the 😳 whole ✋🤚 pack 📦 of 💦 cards: 💯🎫 the 👜🎒😍 Knave was 👏 
standing 🚹 before 🧓🏿 them, 😾👈👉 in 👏 chains, ⛓ with 🅰 a 👺 soldier 🏼👍😭 on 😥 each ✅ side 🤷 to 😍 guard 💂 
him; 🍖🥩 and 👏 near 👁 the ❄ King 🤴🏼 was 👏 the 👞 White 🔘 Rabbit, 😈😳 with 👏 a 👌 trumpet 🎺 in 👏 one 🕐✅✔ hand, 😳🤚 
and ➕ a 💦👌 scroll 😢 of 🌈🥜 parchment in 🔥 the 👏 other. ♋ In ➡ the 🕵 very 💎♀ middle ❗ of 💦 the 👏 court 🏛 
was 👷🌐👔 a 💀 table, 🪑 with ➕ a 👅 large 💧 dish 🏼😳🍽 of 💦 tarts upon 😽🙀 it: 🇮🇹☔ they 📖💆🏾 looked 👀👅 so 😀 good, ✔ 
that 👂🏾 it 🙅👏 made 👉 Alice quite 😋 hungry 🤔🧐 to 👩 look 👀 at 👩 them--'I wish 🙏 they'd 🏻🧑🙋 get 💪 the 🐦

seemed 🍉👼🏿 to 💔 be 🚦 no 😨 chance 🍀 of 🍆 this, 👑👸🏼 so 🌃 she ❌ began 📇👂🏼 looking 👀 at 👌🍆😏 everything 😂🤣 about 😍 
her, ❌📵 to ➡ pass 💯 away 👨 the 💼 time. ⌚👶🏼 

Alice had 🐖 never ❌ been 👴 in 🗝 a 🌰 court 👨 of 💧💦 justice ✊ before, 👈🏾 but 🤔 she 👵👱 had ☝ read 🛋

the 💪 name 🤷 of 🥜 nearly 🍆 everything 😳🐜 there. ✔ 'That's ✔ the 💡 judge,' 👨 she 😩🤣😘 said 👵🏾 to 👂🏼 
herself, 👩👊😭 'because 🤔🤭 of 💦 his 💀🔥 great 👍 wig.' 

The 🏦 judge, 👨 by ♦ the 🔝⏩🔯 way, 👉 was 🤲🏻 the 😂🤣 King; 🤴 and 🍵 as 🏻✌👧 he 👨 wore his 💦 crown 👑 over 💅💖✨ the ❄ 
wig, (look 👀👆 at 👉 the 🌄 frontispiece if 🤷🔎 you 😀 want 😍 to 👴🏿 see 👀 how 💯 he 👦 did 🔨 it,) 🤩 he 👨 did 😂 
not 🙅🏼 look 👀 at 📍 all 🥵 comfortable, 🤘🏽 and 🤩 it ❓❔🤯 was 👏 certainly 🔗 not 🚫 becoming. 😔 

'And 👏 that's ✔ the 👏 jury-box,' thought 💭 Alice, 'and 👏 those 🍑🎁 twelve creatures,' 
(she 💇 was 😭🅰😱 obliged 😉 to ✌ say 👃🏿🍀 'creatures,' you 🔄📃🙍 see, 👀 because 😍 some 🥳 of 💦 them 🤷 were 👶

this 👇 last 🚫 word 😳 two 😛🧙 or ✖ three ⬆↗➡ times 😜 over 🙏🏼❤ to 💦 herself, 👩👊😭 being 👌 rather 👉 proud 😤 of 🚫

age 👴👵 knew 🙀🙈 the 🍏🎅🏾 meaning 😵 of 👏 it 😎 at 👻🕷👹 all. 👷🏾💃 However, 🖐 'jury-men' would 🤔 have 🆓 done ✅

The 🦆 twelve jurors were 🌎 all 😒 writing 📝 very ♀ busily on 🚵🏻 slates. 'What ❓ are 👴 they 👨

'They're ➡ putting ⛳ down ⬇ their ✌ names,' 🏷 the ☝ Gryphon whispered 🗣 in 🔥 reply, 🥺👉👈 'for 🌍

'Stupid 😣 things!' 🤫 Alice began 🔘 in 🤐 a 🤜😎 loud, 🔊 indignant voice, 🗣 but ☝ she 👩 stopped 🤡🔫🤖 
hastily, for 🥵 the 👉🏻 White ☝ Rabbit 🐰🤤🍆 cried 😢😖 out, 😨 'Silence 🙊 in 👉👈🥱 the 👏👤 court!' 👨 and 😏 the 👏 
King 👑❓ put 😳 on 😺 his ♂ spectacles and 🤯 looked 👀 anxiously round, 🔁 to 👉 make 😲 out 😯 who 💁

Alice could 🤔 see, 👀👉 as 🍑 well 😤😯 as 🍑 if 💁 she 😙😚 were 👌 looking 👀 over 🎅🏽 their 🤴👰 shoulders, 
that 🎬 all ❗ the 💯 jurors were 👨 writing 🖊 down ⤵ 'stupid 👁👣👄 things!' 🙋 on 👇 their 🍆 slates, 
and 💖📙👲 she 👱 could 🤭 even 💣💨 make 🤗 out 💩 that 👍 one 😤😖😲 of 🔥 them 🅱 didn't 🙅 know 🤔 how 🤷🏿 to 💦 spell

One 😤😖😲 of 🇺🇸 the 🏪 jurors had 💔 a 🚗 pencil ✏ that 😥 squeaked. This 👆 of 🇪🇸 course, 👴🏿 Alice 
could 🗑 not ❌ stand, 🦵💪✊ and 🍖 she 👱 went 🏃 round ⭕⚪⚫ the 👏 court 👨 and 😡 got 🏟 behind 👋🍦😋 him, 🤔😶 and ➕ 
very 📈👿 soon 🔜 found 👀🧐 an 🌎 opportunity of 💦😎💤 taking 💀 it 😈 away. 🖕 She 👊 did 😻 it 🗣 so 💯 quickly 🚴 
that 🗣 the 🕡🕜 poor 🚫💲 little 👶 juror (it 🙃 was 👏 Bill, 🆑✌🏿 the 🤔 Lizard) 🦎 could 🔒 not 🙅🏻 make 🔨 out 😯

'Herald, read 📘 the 🐳 accusation!' said 🐣 the 🤩 King. 👑❓ 

On 🦍 this 😱 the 🎩 White 👱 Rabbit 🐇🌰 blew 💥🔥💨 three ⚾🌭🦇 blasts on 🔛 the 🌧 trumpet, 🎺 and 🥈 then 👤 
unrolled the 🤕 parchment scroll, 😢 and 👏 read 🔠 as 🅰 follows:-- 😮

'Consider ☺ your 🤗 verdict,' the 😞 King 🤴🏻 said 🔙💰🚟 to 🏃🏽 the 🎸 jury. 

'Not 🚫 yet, 🎩👓👍 not ❌🚫 yet!' 🚫🙅🏾 the 👏 Rabbit 🐰🤤🍆 hastily interrupted. 'There's ❎ a 🅰 great 🇬🇧

'Call ☎ the 👧🏽 first 🥇 witness,' 👀🔭 said 👵🏾 the 👭 King; 🙆🏿 and 😮 the 😒 White 🔘 Rabbit 🐰🤤🍆 blew 💥🔥💨 three ⬆↗➡

The 🤔 first 💒 witness 🕴 was 🙉 the 🎂 Hatter. He 👨🏻 came 💦 in 💰 with 😝 a 👏 teacup in 🔥 one 😤😬

'You 😳 ought to ➡ have 😏🤪 finished,' 👅 said 💬 the 🛍 King. 👑🤴🏻 'When 🕰 did 👌💯 you 🆙 begin?' 🏁 

The 🇺🇸 Hatter looked 👀 at 😠 the 🧼 March Hare, who 🧐 had 🤩🎉🎊 followed 🚓 him 👨🏾 into 🙅🏽 the 🏄🏿

'Fifteenth,' said ⌛ the ⬇ March Hare. 

'Sixteenth,' added 👏 the 🅱👏 Dormouse. 

'Write 📝 that 👩 down,' ⬇ the 👏 King 🤴🏼 said 🔙💰🚟 to 💦 the 🐳 jury, and 👧 the 💔 jury eagerly 🎸😣💃

'Take 🔎 off 🤤 your 👉 hat,' 🧢 the 🌎☝ King 🙆🏿 said 🗣 to 😋 the ☠ Hatter. 

'It 😔 isn't 👎🙅 mine,' 👶🏾 said 🗣 the 📊 Hatter. 

'Stolen!' the 👏 King 🤴🏼 exclaimed, turning 🔄 to 🐝 the 😷 jury, who 💁 instantly 😫 made 👉 a 🌎

'I 👁 keep 🤰 them 💋 to 💦 sell,' 👳💩 the 🔳 Hatter added 👏 as 👨 an 👹 explanation; 'I've 🙋🏻 none 🚫 of 💦

This 😂🚟 did 🙂👍😋 not 😑 seem ♍ to 👂🏻 encourage the 🏀👦🏿 witness 🤔 at 📍 all: 😭😢😵 he 👨 kept 😣 shifting

upsetting all 👏 the 🏙 jurymen on 🔛🇮🇹 to 👉 the 😔 heads 😂 of ⛄ the 🤗 crowd 👨 below, 👇🏻 and 😱 there 👌 
they 👧📚 lay 💏 sprawling about, 🤖 reminding her 😡😨 very ♀🍀 much 😩😂🙀 of 💦 a 👏🏻 globe of 📗 goldfish 
she 👱 had 🈶 accidentally 🙈 upset 😞 the 📚💬👏 week 🙌🏾 before. ↩ 

'Oh, 📱 I 👧 BEG 😩 your 👈 pardon!' she 🐴 exclaimed in 👉👌 a 🎁 tone 🔉 of 👉🤤👷 great 🤔❓ dismay, and 🤔

the 👉🏻 goldfish kept 😣 running 🏃 in 🙇🏾 her ❤ head, 👱 and 👶 she ❓ had 😩🔙 a ❓ vague sort of 💦 idea 🧠 
that 👶🏽 they 💩 must 👍 be 🚷 collected at 👆 once ❗ and 🌎 put 🔛 back 😱 into 📐 the 👏 jury-box, or 😩 
they 👨 would 👪 die. 💀☠ 

'The 🎖🏅 trial 🏛 cannot ❌ proceed,' said 🗣👂🏾 the 👐 King 🙆🏿 in 👨 a 🅱 very 🍀 grave 💀 voice, 🤫 'until 🤬

Alice looked 💥 at 👩 the 🙅🏻😠 jury-box, and 🔥🌿 saw 👀 that, 🔢 in 👂🏻📎 her 😡 haste, she 👱 had 🅰 put 🔻🅰👨

As 👆🏾🎅 soon 🔜 as 😂 the 💪 jury had 🈶 a 🅰 little 🙊 recovered 💚 from 😓 the 🤗 shock 😧 of 🤡 being 🐝

'What 🤨 do 🐮 you 👩 know 😘 about 🏳 this 👈 business?' 💰 the 👍🏻 King 👑🤴🏻 said 💬 to 👂 Alice.

'Nothing 🚫 whatever,' 🤷 said 🤣 Alice. 

'That's ✔ very 💁✅ important,' 😎👌 the 💡 King 🤴 said, 👱🏿💬 turning 📧 to 💦 the 👗 jury. They 💦 were 😩👉

'UNimportant, of 📚 course, 🏎 I 👨 meant,' 🎁 the 📜🍆 King 👑 hastily said, 🗣 and 🆒ℹ went 🏠 on 💦

'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as 😷🌏 if 🎅 he 👨 were 😖 trying 💙😈 
which 🧙 word 👅 sounded 👂🎶 best. 🏆 

Some 🤨 of 😩 the 😯😩 jury wrote ✍🏿 it 😂 down ⬇ 'important,' 😎👌 and 🔪 some 🥳 'unimportant.' 
Alice could 🔒 see 👁 this, 💕 as 🍑 she 👵👩 was 👏 near 😯 enough 👍 to 🧐 look 👀👁 over 🔝 their ✅ slates;

At ❓ this 😏 moment ⚠ the ☠ King, 🤴 who ❓ had 💋 been 🔰 for 🍆 some 🧐 time 🕘 busily writing 📝 in 👉👌

'Nearly 👣 two ✌ miles 🌻🌼🌝 high,' 🆙 added 👏 the 😏🍆👅 Queen. 👑 

'Well, 🤷 I 👀 shan't go, ➡ at 💼 any 💦 rate,' 💯🎨 said 💬 Alice: 'besides, 💦 that's 😳 not 🙅 a ➡

'It's 📍 the 👧🏼 oldest rule 💜 in 🅰 the 🔓💨 book,' 🙌🏼 said 🛸🚶🏿 the 👮 King. 🤴 

'Then 👶 it 💦 ought to 🍆💦 be 🐝 Number 🧮 One,' 💪🎮 said 🗣 Alice. 

The 👏 King ⚠ turned 😲 pale, 🤡 and 👏 shut 🤫 his 👃 note-book hastily. 'Consider ☺ your 📵

'There's 👀👨 more ➕ evidence 📑 to 🔋 come 🏃 yet, 😁😎 please 🙇😖💦 your 👩 Majesty,' said 💬🙈 the ♦ White 💲

'What's 😉 in 🎮🔚 it?' 🇮🇹 said 🗣 the 👏 Queen. 👩 

'I ☠ haven't ❎ opened 😅💃🏿 it 💯 yet,' 🤡😝😣 said 😃😀👩 the 👏 White 🔘 Rabbit, 🐰🤤🍆 'but 👨 it 💋 seems 😤☹ to 🚫 be 👶 a 🔜🐏

'He 👨 must 👏🏽💪 have ⁉ imitated somebody 👀 else's 😤 hand,' 👍 said 💁🏿 the 👏 King. 🤴 (The 👏 jury

'Please 🥺 your 👉 Majesty,' said 💬👱🏿 the 😆 Knave, 'I 🖕 didn't ❌ write ✍ it, 🚗 and 🥂🍸🍾 they 🕋

finished, 🤤 her 👀 sister 👱 kissed 🥵 her, 👱🏻 and 👏 said, 🤤 'It 💯 WAS 👏💁🏻 a 😍 curious 🤓 dream, 💭 
dear, 📝 certainly: 🔗 but ‼ now 🆕 run 🏃🏼 in 👇 to 🐷 your 👉 tea; 🙌🚴🏽 it's 😐 getting 😷 late.' 😰🕗 So 💯 
Alice got 🧶 up 👼🏿 and 👓 ran 🏃🏻 off, 🔞 thinking 🤔💭 while 📆 she 👵👱 ran, 🏃 as 🅱 well ✌ she 💁👵✏ might, 🧘 
what 🥰 a 🔊😮 wonderful 😏 dream 💫 it 🌇 had ☝ been. 😏💴 

But 🍑 her 👩 sister 🙋 sat 🚌 still 💯 just 👩 as 🍼💳😫 she 👱 left ⬅ her, 👩 leaning her 👩 head 👨 on 😭 her 👩 
hand, 😳🤚 watching 👀 the 👏 setting sun, 🌞 and 👏 thinking 🤔 of 🇺🇸 little 🙊 Alice and 💕💻 all 👈🏻 her 👱 
wonderful 👍🏼 Adventures, 🔥 till 😅 she 👩 too 😏 began 👳🏿 dreaming after ⏳ a 🍪 fashion, and 🌊🐻😎 
this 😲😕😦 was 👏 her 👩 dream:-- 💫 

First, 🍆💦🍑 she ❌ dreamed 🤔 of 💦 little 🐥 Alice herself, 👩👊😭 and 👏 once ✔💯 again 😬 the 👏 tiny 👩 
hands ✋ were 🌎 clasped upon 👦 her 😩 knee, and 👏 the 🤑 bright 🌟💫 eager eyes 👁 were 🎊 looking 👁 
up 😤 into 🤩 hers--she could 🔒 hear 👂🏻➕ the 👍🏻 very ♀ tones of 💦 her 🔅 voice, 🎤 and 👨 see 🙈 that 😍 
queer little ▪ toss 🗑 of 👱 her 👊 head 👱 to ➡ keep 🤲 back 💁 the 📲📱 wandering hair 💁🏻 that 🤡 
WOULD 🚸 always ☝ get 🍆 into 🤩 her 💦 eyes--and still 👏 as 🙋 she 👱 listened, or 👏 seemed 😡😠 to 🔙 
listen, 👂‼ the 🏙 whole 💦 place 🏞🌆🌳 around 👀😳 her 🙋 became 🍞👷🏻 alive 🌟 with ✝ the 👏 strange 🌌👮🏾 creatures 
of 😩👉 her 👅 little 👶🏽 sister's 💅🏻💦 dream. 🚟 

The 👽 long 📏 grass 👈🍑😘 rustled at 😁 her 👩 feet 👁🦶🏿 as 🅰 the 👏 White ☺ Rabbit 😈😳 hurried by--the 
frightened 😨 Mouse 🐀 splashed his 👊🍖 way 💫 through 😸 the 🍂 neighbouring pool--she 
could 🧐 hear 👂 the 😮 rattle of 🌲😫 the 🧼 teacups as 🚾 the 👸 March Hare and ➕ his 😵 friends 🙂 
shared 💋 their 🔫💶 never-ending meal, 🥘 and 💕 the 🛣 shrill voice 🤫 of 💦 the 👏 Queen 👩 
ordering off 📉 her 🉑👍♏ unfortunate guests to ➡ execution--once more 😓 the 👉🏻 pig-baby 
was 👏 sneezing 💧 on 😩😖 the 👏 Duchess's knee, while ⏱ plates 🍝 and 💬 dishes crashed 
around ↔ it--once more 👏 the 🅱 shriek of ♦ the 🧼 Gryphon, the 🌌🎇🎆 squeaking of 🔺 the 😤🚗 
Lizard's slate-pencil, and 😤 the 😭 choking 🤭 of 💨 the 🦊 suppressed guinea-pigs, 
filled 🥛 the 👏 air, 😵😂 mixed 🆙 up 👉 with 👨 the 📈⬆ distant 🗺 sobs of 😾 the 👮 miserable Mock 💁 
Turtle. 

So 💯 she 👩🏾 sat 🚌 on, 🔛 with 😘 closed 🚫⛔🙅 eyes, ✨👁🙈 and 😶 half 🐈➗💰 believed herself 🤷 in ➡ 
Wonderland, though ❤ she 💁👵✏ knew 🤔 she 👩 had 🚯➿🅾 but 😣 to 😣 open 😋 them 😣👭 again, 🕣 and 👏 all 😷 
would 🎄 change 👀 to 🔋 dull reality--the grass 🍃 would 💁😑 be 🐝 only 🕦 rustling in 🚏 the 🙆👏 
wind, 💨 and 👶 the 😢😛 pool 🎱 rippling to 😫 the 🎷 waving of 🇺🇸 the ⚡ reeds--the rattling 📳 
teacups would 👪 change 😤 to 💦 tinkling sheep-bells, and 🖕 the ☪ Queen's 💅💋 shrill 
cries 😫😩 to 💦 the 👏 voice 🐸 of 💦 the 🙆👏 shepherd boy--and the 🏦 sneeze 👏💵👠 of 📚 the 👏 baby, 🍼 the 👏 
shriek of 🥰 the 🚱 Gryphon, and 👩 all 🆑😎👗 the 🤢 other 🙌👆 queer noises, ❓ would 🌴 change ♟📰 (she 🐰💕😍 
knew) 👓 to 👏 the 👏 confused 🤷 clamour of 🌬 the 👏🏾 busy farm-yard--while the 🤪 lowing 
of 🏻🚋 the 🌍 cattle 🐄 in 👏 the 😳 distance 🚫🤦 would ⛳ take 🖐😩 the 😕😘🤨 place 😒 of 💦 the 🧼 Mock 💁 Turtle's 😳🐢👊 
heavy 🏋 sobs. 

Lastly, she 👩🏾 pictured to 🤔💰 herself 👩👊😭 how 🤔 this 👈 same 🚫👱🏻 little 👌 sister 👱 of 🍢🔺🔨 hers 
would, 🤔 in 👏 the 🤚 after-time, be 😥 herself 🤷 a 🅰 grown 🗣 woman; 👩 and ➕ how 🤔 she ✋ would 😢 
keep, ✊🏻 through 🔜 all 😱 her 💋 riper years, 🤷 the 👄 simple 🙌👆 and 🔒 loving 😍 heart 💘 of 💦 her ♀ 
childhood: 😂 and 😩👌💦 how 🤔 she 👩👵 would 👍🤷 gather 👨 about 🤔💭 her 🍑 other 👨 little 😂😃 children, 👩 and 💨 
make 🔨 THEIR 🏻🧒👦 eyes 👀 bright 🌟💫 and 💼👏💴 eager with 🥰 many 👬 a ⭐ strange 🧐🥵🤤 tale, 🍼📕 perhaps 💯 even 😯 
with ⏮💦 the 🔔 dream 💫 of 💦 Wonderland of 🔥 long 📏 ago: 👶🏽 and 🤡 how ❓💯 she 👊 would 👪 feel 🖤 with 👏 
all 🤪🤯 their 🤪 simple ✅ sorrows, and 👏 find 🙄 a ✊🏽🛄 pleasure 💦 in 👏 all 🔁 their 🤑🤮🤢 simple 🍦 joys, 
remembering her 😫 own 😭 child-life, and 🙋 the 💯 happy 😁 summer 😎🔥🚒 days. 📅
