huogbz,"Grandma, tell me a story! 👵","“Grandma 👵, did people really not 🚫 wear masks 😷 when you were a kid 🧒?”

“No ❌, they didn't. People 👫 didn't start wearing masks 😷 until I was 33 3️⃣3️⃣, in 2020 🗓. Reuben, your daddy 👨🏻, was 4 when it all started.”

Bobby wrinkles his nose 👃at me and picks up his mask 😷by the door🚪.

“You mean you didn't ❌wear a mask 😷 at ALL?!” 🚫He says, swinging his around on his finger.👇🏻

“No, 🛑 not ever.” I say.❌

“But how did you stay safe🧸?” Bobby says, setting his mask 😷 down.

“Oh, we got sick 🤮 a lot. Your daddy had the flu 🤢 when he was 3. 👶 It was scary, but he pulled through. He's had his share of colds 🤒as a child.”

“That's scary👻. It's bad to get sick🤧.”

I stop 🛑, and think. Is it time⏰? Yes✅, it must be time🕑. Bobby will be eight8️⃣ soon, and there are things he needs to know🧠. Things it might not⛔️ be safe for his father👨🏻 or his mother 👩🏻 to talk about, things that are safer shared from an older 🔞 mouth👄.

I snuggle 🤱🏻 him up on the couch 🛋 and try to think 🤔 of where to begin.

“Now Bobby👦. I'm going to tell you some things. I want to you to hold these things inside of you and don't talk ❌about them to anyone else, you hear? Some of these ideas 💡 can be misunderstood if the wrong ⛔️ person hears them.”

I think💭 he understands. I hope🤞 he understands.

“Back in 2020 there was a virus🦠 . You probably learned about it in school 🏫 .”

“Covid 19🧫” Bobby says. He isn't smiling 😕. “I did.”

“Yes, Covid 19. 🤒That was when everything changed🔜.”

“Is that why you had to go to jail, 👮🏻‍♂️Grandma👵🏻?”

Now my heart ❤️sinks🚰. He's getting ahead of me.

“No, ❌not really.” I say.

“Daddy 👨🏻 says you had to go to jail 🚔 when he was little and he missed 😢  you a lot.”

I feel tears 😭 prick the edges of my vision 👁, but I blink them away.

“Yes, you see, Grandma 👵🏻 didn't like vaccines. 💉 I didn't want to vaccinate 🩺 my 👶, but a few years after covid-19 🧬 we lost the right to choose things like that. But Grandma 👵🏻 didn't give up. I fought for the right to keep Reuben and Rebekah free from vaccines 💉, so I went to jail 🚓 for awhile. It was hard for your daddy 👨🏻, he missed 😢 me a lot.”

Bobby 👦 holds my hand 🤝, and I remember 💭 another little boy 👦 , so many years ago who also sat on this couch 🛋 and held my hand. And I remember his tears 😭 as the police 👮 took me away from him. I don't want to remember 🧠 this.

“But vaccines 💉 are good ✅ for you, Grandma 👵🏻 . They keep you safe 🧸. We learned about them in school👩🏻‍🏫.”

I sigh.😥

“That's what they say.” I say. “Yet, back when I was a kid, 👧 sometime people died ☠️ after they were vaccinated 🩺. Sometimes people were damaged 🤕 by the vaccines 🧪. And we still don't know 🧠what is in them. No one will tell us.”

I turn to look into Bobby's eyes👀. “People still are damaged by vaccines 🔬now. Just no 🚫one talks about it.”

Bobby scrunches his eyes 👀up. He's trying so hard to wrap his mind🧠 around my words.📝

“The world 🌎 was a very different place when I grew up.” I say. “We had coins, 💰like the ones in my collection. We spent those coins 💵as money💸, instead of using the chips🔩 we have today. No one wore masks 😷and you didn't have to get vaccinated💉 if you didn't want too. Parents could teach 👩🏻‍🏫their kids at home 🏘if they wanted, and school wasn't year round. 📆You could think 🤔what you wanted, no one was arrested⛓ for speaking their mind. 🧠People met in churches 💒to sing to God.”

Bobby still looks confused. I wonder if he can even picture 🖼 a world🌎 like I am describing. I wonder if he can even understand. 🤔

“Kids 👦👧 played ⚽️together in the streets. 🛣 We had birthday 🎂 parties where people would come to your house 🏡 and hang out. I could hug my friends 👩‍❤️‍👩 whenever I wanted.” Now I am getting a bit choked up. It must be my age. I'll be 76 👵🏻 this January.

I swallow. 

“Now, Bobby dear, don't 🚫 go repeating anything I've told you. Keep it hidden in your heart ❤️, like the verses 📜we learn over breakfast🍳.”
“Like the bible 📔under the planks in the shed🏚?” He asks. I nod, yes, like the bible 💒hidden in the shed.

Bobby slips from my side. I let him go, hearing 🦻the legos tinkle from the other room. The legos his dad collected as a kid.👦

I sit 🪑for awhile, thinking 🤔 back. Times 🗓sure have changed. I don't think they have changed for the better, no matter ❌what the government🇺🇸 says. I wonder 🧠what other things will change, before my bones 💀go into the Earth⚰️. Soon the memories 💖of that other world, that world of freedom 🔓and breath... will be buried in my tomb⚰️ with me. And only the young will remember.🧠

If they can.💣"

huedvj,Dear📔Diary 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣0️⃣ Edition,"In ❄️ January, 🔥 Australia caught on fire. I don’t even know if that fire was put out, because we straight up almost went to war with Iran 🇮🇷 . We might actually still be almost at war with them 🤔. I don’t know, because 👩 Jen Aniston and 👨🏻 Brad Pitt spoke to one another at an awards 🏆 show and everyone flipped the crap out 😲, but then there was this thing happening in 🦇 🇨🇳 China, then 👑 Prince Harry and Megan ✌🏼 peaced out of the Royal family, and there was the whole impeachment trial 👩‍⚖️ , and then corona virus 🦠 showed up in the US ✔️“officially,” but then 🏀 Kobe died 😭and UK 🇬🇧 peaced out of the European Union.

In February, 🌽 Iowa crapped 💩 itself with the caucus results and the president was acquitted and the 👩🏼‍💼Speaker of the House took ten. Whole. years. to rip up a speech , but then The👨‍🔬 🌎WHO decided to give this virus a name COVID-19, which confused 🤔some really important people 👔 in charge of, like, our lives, into thinking there were 18 other versions before it, but then Harvey Weinstein was found guilty👨🏻‍⚖️, and 🇺🇸 Americans started asking if Corona beer 🍺 was safe to drink🤦🏻‍♀️, and everyone on Facebook became a doctor 👨‍⚕️ who just knew the 🤒flu like killed way more people than COVID 1 through 18.

In March, stuff hit the fan👿. Warren dropped out of the presidential race and Sanders was like Bernie or bust 💥, but then Italy 🇮🇹 shut its whole country down 🚷, and then COVID Not 1 through 18 officially become what everyone already realized, a 😱pandemic and then a nationwide state of emergency 🆘was declared in US 🇺🇸 , but it didn’t really change anything, so everyone was confused or thought it was still just a flu 💁🏻‍♀️, but then COVID Not 18 was like ya’ll not taking me seriously? 💡 I’m gonna infect the one celebrity everyone loves and totally infected Tom Hanks👨🏻, get y’all to close all of the schools so y’all can 🙏🏼 appreciate teachers 👩‍🏫 for once (because you can’t teach them anything other than how to use a touch screen🤦🏻‍♀️ ) close down all of salons so you can’t get your 💇‍♂️ hair or your nails done💅 , everyone had to work from home and attend Zoom meetings in their underwear. The 📉 DOW took a crap 💩 on itself, and most of us still don’t understand why the stock market is so important or even a thing 🤔 (I still don’t), We were then all introduced to 🐅 Tiger King and the ONE thing we can all agree on this year , 👍🏼Carol totally killed her husband⚰️ ..... whacked him! And then Netflix was like you’re welcome, and we all realized there was no way we were washing our hands enough in the first place because all of our hands are now dry and gross and were all searching for lotion now.

In 🌧 April, Bernie finally busted✌🏼 himself out of the presidential race 🏃 , but then NYC 🗽became the set of The Walking Dead 💀 and we learned that no one has face masks 😷, ventilators, or toilet paper, or THE FREAKING SWIFFER WET JET LIQUID , and by now our 🦁outgrowth is showing, so there’s a shortage on 📦 box hair dye and all of our hair dressers are like , 😱 NO DONT DO IT!!! But, then Kim Jong-Un died, but then he came back to life … or did he? Who knows, because then the Pentagon released 🎥 videos of UFOs and nobody cared, and we were like man, it’s only April….

In 💐 May, the biblical end times kicked off , historical locust swarms, we learned of murder hornets 🐝 and realized that 2020 was the start of the Hunger Games🙈 however people forgot to let us know. people legit started to protest lockdown measures with 🔫 AR-15s, 🏀⚾️sports events were cancelled everywhere. But then people all over America finally reached a breaking point with race issues and violence. There were 🗣protests in every city🌃 ,which was confusing to some of us because people were definitely gathering in 👫crowds of more than 🖐🏼🤚🏼10 and for sure closer than 6 foot away ⬅️➡️from each other . Those people must have forgotten about the 😖pandemic called COVID Not One Through 18. Media 📺 🗞 struggled with how to 🤬focus on two important things at once, people in general struggle to focus on more than one important thing. A dead whale 🐋 was found in the middle of the Amazon rain forest 🌳 after monkeys 🐒 stole COVID 1 Through 19 from a lab 🔬 and ran off with them, and either in May or April (no one is keeping track of time now) that a giant asteroid ☄️ narrowly missed the Earth🌍.

In ☀️ June, common sense just got thrown 🤾🏼 straight out the window and somehow 😷 wearing masks became a 🏛political thing, but then everyone sort of remembered there was a pandemic,  then 👨‍🔬scientists announced they found a mysterious undiscovered mass at the center of the earth, and everyone was like 🙅🏽‍♂️🙅🏻‍♀️🚧DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH IT, but then everyone took a pause to realize that people actually believed Gone With The Wind 💨 was like non-fiction, but then it was also announced that there is a strange 🛰radio signal coming from somewhere in the universe 🌌 that repeats itself every so many days 🗓 , and everyone was like 👽 DON’T YOU DARE ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH IT‼️🚫 but then America reopened 🙌🏼from the shut down that actually wasn’t even a shut down, and so far, things have gone spectacularly .... not that great 👎🏼. All of the Karen’s came out at once, and people started tearing down 🔨 statues. Everyone is on Facebook arguing 🤼‍♀️ about masks 👃🏼, but then Florida 🏖 was like hold my beer 🍺 and let me show you how we’re number one 🥇 in all things, including new Not Corona Beer Coronavirus. Then we learned there was a massive dust cloud ☁️ coming straight at us 📍from the Sahara Desert 🐫 , which is totally normal, but this is 2020, so the 👻 ghost mummy thing is most likely in that dust cloud. We then 📚 learned of meth-gators 🐊 , and I'm like that is so not on my flipping 2020 Bingo card 😡 can we use it as the free space?? 🤷🏻 Then we learned that the Congo's worst ever Ebola 🚨 outbreak is over 😓, and we were all like, there was an Ebola outbreak that was the worse ever? 👀 ....... and don’t forget we just discovered FLYING SNAKES! 🐍, seriously! FLYING SNAKES!!!!

So here comes July…. at this point we are over it , just tell us what’s next .... 👽 Aliens? 🔱Zeus? ☄️ Asteroids? Artificial Intelligence becomes self aware? Can it just be something cool 😎 or fun for once? Maybe even a good laugh , like hahaha 😂 April Fools! We all actually wouldn’t mind that joke at this point.

Also, why didn't I know about the whale in the Amazon? Or a few other things because I just can’t keep up."

Then you have rage, anger, nightmares, mental health and lose your divine body to these evil creatures, you are a lab- rat. 
First thing you need to say ALOT is ;"" I CHOOSE GOD!""
Then you need to learn the LORDS PRAYER and say that A LOT!
Then wear a blessed cross, go to a Priest and ask for the knecklace to be blessed  a crucifix cross most powerful. Get Holy water and take a sip night and day, Holy Prayer is in your body. Go to Mass! Do this if you are NOT CATHOLIC too.👍
Confession must be done. You will need all of this to get these demonics off you or out of you it's a must. Take Holy Communion is huge and a must weekly or daily. It's a PRAYER LIFE now for you to stay shielded and clean. The Grey's, Reptiods, humanoid, and disembodied evil spirits are ALL DEMONIC EVILS. FACT! And they will not let go easily.😔

hqs42z,Yandere 😩 dev's response to why the game runs terribly 🧠 🤏,"Yes 👍, development 👓 began 🔘 6 👻👽😺 years 📅 ago ↩. But 💩 Yandere Simulator is much 😩😂🙀 more ambitious 💄💋👄 and complex 😤 than an average 🐕 indie 😼🐴 game 🎮. The premise itself may ♦ seem ♍🉐🔄 straightforward, but 🍑 the number 🔢☝ of features 🧬 and depth 😳 of mechanics 👋🏻 is comparable to that of AAA open-world sandbox titles 🤭🤤🍆. It's unrealistic to expect 🤗 a game 🎱 like 👍 this to reach ✋ the optimization stage 👉 in less 😂 than 6 💪❗❓ years 🗓, simply 🔢 due ☑🔘 to the unusually large 👀 scope and deep ⬇ complexity 😤 of the game 🎱, coupled with the fact 📚📖 that it's mostly 💯 being developed 🚀 by a single 🕑 person 👥. Nobody ❌ can accurately ☑ estimate how long ⏳ it should take 👊 to teach 👩‍🏫 the optimization stage 4️⃣💖, because there isn't a pre-existing project ⛲ that Yandere Sim can be compared to.

No ❌ solo 🎸 developer 👓 has ever 😠 attempted 🚫 to build 🏢 a social ❤ stealth 🤫 school 🏫 simulation sandbox game 🎮 before 😂. The length 🏠 of time ⌛ that it takes 👫 for a single 🕑 man 👨 to develop 👓 a game 🎮 like 💛 this has simply 🍦 not been established 🔍 yet 😏, so ""it's been 6 🦖 years 🗓, you 👉🏻 should have optimized the game 🎮 by now"" is simply 🔢 not a valid 🌟 statement 🇺🇸.

Even 🌃 with the above 🆙 information 👌🏼 in mind 🤯, I 👥 do think 💭 that the game 🎮 should be further into development 👓 by now, but ✋🏾 there are factors ❌ that massively 🚚 slowed down 👇 the game's 🎱 development 👓 and put 👏 the game 🎮 way ↕ behind ↩ schedule 😤.

Early 🕑 in the game's 🎱 development 👓, I 👥 adopted 👩‍👦 an unreasonable update 👄 schedule 📅; one ☝ major ↔ feature 🧬 every ☝ 2 🥈 weeks 🌖🌑. As a result 😏, the game 🎱 was developed 💥 under 😀 ""crunch 😸 time ⏰"" for several ♀♂🚁 years 📅 straight 💏; 15-hour workdays, no 🚫 vacations 🧩, constantly 💯 sacrificing physical 👅🔭🔬 and psychological 🤕 health 🚑, etc 🛫🛬. This caused me to become 🔜 ""burned 🔥 out"", which severely 👎 reduced my productivity. Due 🙈 to my ongoing obligation to devote most of my time ⏰ to Yandere Simulator, I 👥 have never ❌ had an opportunity to recover from this burnout and return ↩ to normal 👩‍🦯 levels 📏 of productivity.

There is another 2️⃣ factor ✌ that is much 😩😂🙀 more important ‼ than that, though 😳😏. I 👥 have been mischaracterized, misportrayed, misrepresented, and character 👦👱‍♀️ assassinated by drama 😢🙍‍♂️ YouTubers who financially 💵 benefit 👍 from producing 👏🏻 content 🗞 where they ridicule 👂🗣, shame 😳, humiliate 📼, and vilify their target 👈. Going 🏃 through this experience 🧠 has caused me to feel ❤ like 👍 my life 💓 and career 🤑💸 are permanently 🐐 destroyed 😂, which has killed 💀 my motivation to work 👩‍🏭 on the game 🎮, reducing ⏬😜 my productivity further."

holr8q,My 😛😝boyfriend 👬 is a beanatarian,"My boyfriend 👬 told 💬 me 3 3️⃣ weeks 🗓📆 ago ↩ that he 🧒 has decided ✅ to convert to a ""beanatarian"" diet 🐖. He 👨 told 🗣 me he 👨 will from now only only eat 🍴 different 😡 types 🙀 of beans 😋. I 👥 thought 💭 he 🧒 was joking 😁🦋💖 at first ☝1️⃣ but I 👥 have literally 😎 seen 👀 him 🤬 eat 🍽 nothing 🚫 but beans 🍭 and multivitamins every 👏 day 📆 for 3 🤐 weeks 🌖🌑.

He 👨 insists that ""Almost 🤔😔💭 all 💯 nutrients 😂 can be derived 🔜 from beans 🥒"", and he 👨 takes 👊 2 ✌ multivitamins a day 📆 ""just in case 🔺"".

I 👥 can't ❌ believe 🙅🏻 he 👨 thinks 💭 this is healthy 🚑. We have two ✌ cabinets 🗄 that have been completely 🚫 overtaken by different 😡 types ⌨ of canned 🥫 beans 🍭. For breakfast 🥣, lunch 🥡, and dinner 🍣 he 👨 eats 🍽 beans 👀. Sometimes 😊 he 👨 just eats 🍽 them without 🚫 heating 🔥👇, sometimes ✨ he 🧒 fries 🍟 them in a pan 🍳, sometimes ✨ he 🧒 boils 🔥 them, sometimes ✨ he 👨 bakes ✨💞🧚 them, sometimes ✨ he 👨 tries 😐 to make 🔨 refried beans 😋. He 👨 will add ➕ spices 🌶🥵 and sometimes 😊 a hot 🔥 sauce 🍆💦😩 but otherwise 💯 he 🧒 has eaten 😛 no 🚫 other food 😩.

I 👥 went 💨 with him 🤬 to a restaurant 🏪🏠 last ♿ night 🌚. He 👨 saw 👀 they had a vegetarian 💅🏻🦋🥺 chili 👋 option that included pinto beans 👀. He 🧒 asked ❔ the waiter 🧚🏼 to just give 🎁 him 👴 a bowl 🍀 of those beans 🥒, ""cooked 🍳 to the chef's 👨🏿‍🍳 preferred 🍞 bean 🥫 style 😎🤩."" The waiter 🧚🏼 was so confused 🤷‍♂️🤨🤔, and I 👥 was so mortified. The waiter 🚏 had to go 🏃 back ⬅ into the kitchen 🐶 to ask ❓ if it was okay 👌 and they worked 👷‍♂️ something 😅 out because they made 👉 him 👴 a bowl 🍀 of beans 🥒.

I 👥 had a serious 😐 sit-down with him 🤬 yesterday 🔺 and said 💬 I 👥 was concerned 🤑 for his 👋 health 🚑. He 👨 told 🗣 me that beans 😋 have all 💯 kinds 🙁 of protein 🍗 and have all 💯 other sorts of nutrients 💩😤, and that just in case 🔺 his 👋 multivitamins ""would pick ⛏ up ☝ the slack 😰."" I 👁 told 🗣 him 👴 if he 👨 wanted ⚠ to be a vegetarian 💅🏻🦋🥺 or a vegan 🐮 I 👥 would be totally 💯 on board ♂🏊, I 👁 am even 🌃 mostly ⚠ vegetarian 💅🏻🦋🥺 already 😞 so I'd 😗 be willing 👨🏾 to pursue that with him 👴, but he 👨 insists he 👨 must 🤜 only be a beanatarian.

I 👁 told 🗣 him 🤬 I 👁 was worried 😟😳 and annoyed 😠 by his 💦 bean 🥫 based 👌💯💦 behavior 💀 and he 👨 told 🗣 me ""You're just not proud 😤 of my beanatarian lifestyle""....and I 👥 was like 😄, yeah 💕🔳, no 🙅, I'm 😎 not. It's fucking 🍆 weird 😕 and not healthy 😳👉👈.

He 👨 told 🗣 me that he 🧒 was planning 📑 on writing 📝 a book 📚 about his 👋 beanatarian lifestyle 🌎 that would be half 💀 ""bean 🥫 philosophy 🎭"" and ""bean 🍭 facts 🤥🙅‍♀️"" and the second ⏱ half 1️⃣➗2️⃣ would be ""bean 🍭 recipes 📖.""

I 👥 became 🧚🏼‍♂️ exasperated and told 🗣 him 👴 he 👨 needed 😨 to stop 🚫 this nonsense 🙄🙃🤪 but he 👨 said 🗣 if I 👥 can't ❌ accept 😕 his 👋 beanatarianism then he 🧒 couldn't accept 😕 me and we would have to break 💔 up 👆.

My relationship 💓💋 might 🤔 end 🔚 because of this and honestly 💯 I 👁 do see 👀 him 👴 differently 😡 because I 👁 never ❌ realized 👀 in our 2 ✌ years 🗓 of dating 🤔😯😫 that he 👨 could be this irrational and stubborn 😖. But I 👁 am also 👨 worried 😟 about him 👴 and wondering ❓🤔 if I 👥 should have a bean 😋 intervention with his 👋 friends 🐶, I 👁 am not the only one ☝ disturbed by his 💦 diet 😛😝🔫.

hn9y7g,Lucky Charms Essay on Warplanes,"https://www.reddit.com/r/F35Lightning/comments/hkf3qm/unconfirmed_india_is_ready_to_abandon_the_su57/fwx54pp/

India already [withdrew](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/20347/its-no-surprise-india-finally-ditched-its-stealth-fighter-program-with-russia) from joint development of the Su-57 in '18. 🇷🇺 had cut down on its own planned purchases of the ✈️ due to budget pressures, which ⬆️ the cost for 🇮🇳, angering New Delhi. Then there's the fact that the engine is an ""interim"" one whose stealth isn't up to par. Since the program started in '06 only 10 prototypes & 1 serial production ✈️ have been built, & the serial production model [promptly crashed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/tass.com/emergencies/1102811/amp).

The Su-57 is likely to be the aerial counterpart to the T-14 Armata. 🇷🇺 originally wanted >2,000 of the tanks by 2020, then 2025, and have now [rejected full rate production](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/22600/russia-cant-afford-its-new-t-14-armata-tanks-turns-to-updated-older-designs-instead) altogether in favor of a limited ""test batch"".

Moscow simply doesn't have the 💰 to replace its massive Soviet-era arsenal today, even IF it can still do the R&D. It's a catch-22 b/c if they focus on upgrading existing equipment to maintain their image as a great military power, that leaves fewer rubles for new toys. Then there's all the 💰 needed to spend on the strategic ☢️🚀 stuff like submarines.

The strategy they'll probably adopt for all forces is the one they've taken for the navy: scale back expectations & focus on core capabilities. 🇷🇺 hasn't built a surface ship greater than 5,000 tons since the end of the USSR. Destroyers are replaced w/ frigates, frigates w/ missile boats, & so on. Fantasies like carriers are [put aside](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_23000E), & 🇷🇺 interests retrenched from to green to brown water."

hmut5f,🐵🙈🙉🙊🐒Monkeys 🐒🙊🙉🙈🐵,"I 👥 like 😄 monkeys 🐵

I 👥 like 👍 monkeys 🐒.

The pet 🚫🐶🐱 store 🏬 was selling 💸 them for five ✋ cents 💳 a piece 🧩. I 👥 thought 🤔 that odd since 💦 they were normally a couple 🚗🏠 thousand ♾. I 👥 decided ✌🏻 not to look 👀 a gift 🎁🎀🛍 horse 🐎 in the mouth 👄. I 👥 bought 💸 200.

I 👥 like 👍 monkeys 🐵.

I 👥 took 👫 my 200 monkeys 🙈 home 🏡. I 👥 have a big 😳 car 🚘. I 👥 let 👏 one 1️⃣ drive 🚦. His 💦 name 🏷 was Sigmund. He 👨 was retarded 🤦🤷⁉. In fact 📚📖, none 🚫 of them were really 💯 bright 🔆. They kept 😣 punching themselves in their genitals 🐵. I 👁 laughed 😡. Then they punched 🤜👊 my genitals 🍆🍠. I 👥 stopped ✋ laughing 🤣.

I 👥 herded them into my room 🏠. They didn't adapt very 💯 well 🤔 to their new 🆕 environment ♻. They would screech 🤬, hurl themselves off of the couch 👬 at high 🔫 speeds 🚅 and slam 😡 into the wall 🚪.

Although 😏 humourous at first ☝1️⃣, the spectacle lost 🛅 its novelty halfway into its third 🏳️‍🌈 hour 😞😳.

Two ✌ hours 🕐 later 🕑 I 👥 found 🔍 out why ❓ all 💯 the monkeys 🙈 were so inexpensive: they all 💯 died 😵. No 🙅 apparent 💢 reason 😒. They all 💯 just sorta' dropped 😱 dead 💀. Kinda' 🍕 like 😄 when ⏰ you 👈 buy 💵 a goldfish and it dies 💀 five ✋ hours 😞😳 later ⌚⏱⏳. Damn 😤 cheap 🦀 monkeys 🐒.

I 👥 didn't know 🧠 what to do. There were 200 dead ☠ monkeys 🐒 lying 🤫 all 💯 over 👏 my room 🏠, on the bed 🛌, in the dresser 👗👠💄, hanging 🧚🏼‍♀️❤🌸 from my bookcase. It looked 👀 like 😄 I 👥 had 200 throw 😷 rugs 😳.

I 👁 tried 👋 to flush one 1️⃣ down ⤵ the toilet 🚽. It didn't work 💼. It got 👏 stuck 🧠. Then I 👥 had one ☝ dead ☠, wet 💦 monkey 🙈 and 199 dead 💀, dry 🤡 monkeys 🐵.

I 👥 tried 🇮🇹 pretending 🤧😭 that they were just stuffed 😜 animals 🐕. That worked 👷‍♂️ for a while, that is until they began 🆚 to decompose. It started 🆕 to smell 👃 real 💯 bad 👎.

I 👥 had to pee 💦 but 🍑 there was a dead 💀 monkey 🐒 in the toilet 🚽 and I 👥 didn't want 😍 to call 📞 the plumber. I 👁 was embarrassed 😊.

I 👥 tried 🇮🇹 to slow 😍🍝😳 down ⤵ the decomposition by freezing ❄😱 them. Unfortunately 😔, there was only enough 💦 room 🤴👸 for two ✌ monkeys 🙈 at a time ⏰ so I 👁 had to change 👏 them every 👏 30 🔞 seconds 🥈. I 👁 also 👨 had to eat 🍽 all 😷 the food 😩 in the freezer ❄😱 so it didn't all 💯 go 🏃 bad 👎.

I 👥 tried 👋 burning 🔥 them. Little 👌 did I 👥 know 🤔 my bed 🛌 was flammable. I 👥 had to extinguish 🧯 the fire 🔥.

Then I 👥 had one 1️⃣ dead 💀, wet 💦 monkey 🐵 in my toilet 🚽, two ✌ dead 💀, frozen ⛄ monkeys 🙊 in my freezer ❄, and 197 dead ☠, charred monkeys 🐒 in a pile 💩 on my bed 🛏. The odour 💩 wasn't improving.

I 👥 became 🚡 agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys 🙊 and to use 🤮 the bathroom 🚾💣💢. I 👥 severely 📉 beat 💖 one ☝ of my monkeys 🙈. I 👁 felt 🤚 better 👍.

I 👥 tried 🇮🇹 throwing 👐💢 them away ➡ but 🍑 the garbage 👳🏾‍♂️👨🏿↙ man 👨 said 💬 that the city 🌃 was not allowed ❌ to dispose of charred primates. I 👥 told 🗣 him 👴 that I 👁 had a wet 💦 one ☝. He 👨 couldn't take 👫 that one ☝ either 🤔👥. I 👥 didn't bother ☝ asking ⁉ about the frozen ❄ ones ☝.

I 👥 finally 👆 arrived 🤡 at a solution 💡🤔. I 👥 gave 🎁 them out as Christmas 🎄 gifts 🎁. My friends 👯‍♂️ didn't know 🤔 quite ✅ what to say 🗣. They pretended that they like 😄 them, but 🍑 I 👥 could tell 🗣 they were lying 🤥.

Ingrates.

So I 👥 punched 🤜💥 them in the genitals 🐵.

I 👥 like 👍 monkeys 🙊."

hjqvfc,How I Learned to Love Writing With Emojis,"Oh, I give up! Give me words! Real words! They’re so much easier.  🍑 as much as I want to 🏃 from these cartoons, I ⛔️.They are rapidly seeping into the vernacular of the 🌐. It’s a ⚓️ or 🏊️ situation. 

 I get 📧 now with little characters in the subject line. My text messages and social media feeds are increasingly 🌝 of 😃-only sentences or thoughts. Instagram, specifically, says nearly  nearly 4️⃣ 0️⃣ % of the text posts on its apps contain emojis. Domino’s even lets you order a pie now via tweet with just a 🍕.

 Emoji is the new lingua franca. and like learning any new language, brain power, practice and tricks are required—especially for an idiom that has 💩 and 👻 but no equal sign.   
 Unfortunately, there is no 🌹 💎 for emoji yet, so this week I took it upon myself to create my own 😃 🏫 and become a better emoji-unicator. 

# Understand the Language

My first 📶 was understanding that  😃 is unlike any other language out there. Yes, a small character can be a substitute for a word, or many words—similar to Chinese. But taken together, the language lacks the grammar, vocabulary, syntax and semantics of a true language.

The result can be complete and utter ambiguity, which is why most are confused by a string of characters sewn together. Take, for instance, this coupling  🚗 🏠️ .

“So… a car and a house. Easy!” Yes, that’s obviously the literal translation. But it could also mean “I am going home.” Or it could mean “I left the car at home.” Or it could even mean a “car’s house,” aka “garage”—since there isn’t a dedicated character for that.

 But emojis have a “useful ambiguity,” says Mark Davis, the president and co-founder of Unicode, the group charged with defining the characters for all  📱 💻️  ​—including emoji ​characters. He believes they are best used as an “adjunct” to text—especially in social media—helping to ​make up for the the lack of gestures, ​facial ​expressions and ​intonation ​found in speech​.​​ 

 “ 😃 😎 💪 💃 📱 ⌛️ 📏 🔗 📖 ➕ 🍲 😋 🔵 🌻 😂 ""  Dr. Davis said. 

 He thought I was a bit   🌰 🌰 🌰  for even attempting to write the first part of this article strictly in  😃 .   
 But even to just supplement text with emoji, you need to adjust your brain to think visually: how to communicate in cartoon. 

 For me, that meant replacing certain quick responses and feelings with some basic characters. A  👍️  is an easy way to say “Sounds good!” I can convey my bad mood about having to work on Sunday with just a  😡  or my excitement for my sister’s landing a new job with not one  😍  but  😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 . 

 When I started to embrace that, I felt in some peculiar way that my text messages had more emotion. In switching from  ☎️ and 👫  communications to primarily  📄 , we have lost out on the feelings that can only be conveyed in inflection and  😊 😝 😂 😣 😭 😥 😩 😮 .

# Learn the Vocabulary

Getting a handle on just how and when I should start using emojis instead of words was the easy part, figuring out how to actually  🔎  the emojis to help me express myself was much harder.

The best  💬 I got came from Jonas Downey, a self-proclaimed expert emoji communicator and co-creator of Emojisaurus.com, a website that provides emoji translations of popular phrases.

 “ 😮 1️⃣ 0️⃣ 0️⃣ ❓️ 😬 💡 📝 💯,”  Mr. Downey told me. “Making emoji phrases is like writing sentences in English—you get better when you know the whole vocabulary.”

So I took his 💬 : I sat down with the iOS emoji keyboard, and got to  📚️ . Why hadn’t I been using  💪  to tell people I was at the gym? Or  👉️ 🍷  to ask people out for drinks? Or   🚽 to say, well, you know?

The trouble is that the characters that would best express ourselves aren’t always there. One reason is that emoji comes from 🎌. (In Japanese, emoji means “picture character.”) By my count,  5️⃣  % of the nearly  9️⃣ 0️⃣ 0️⃣ emojis available to  📱  users aren't going to be useful to many people in the U.S., like  🏮 and 🔰 .

That also means many potentially useful characters are missing. While there are  🐥 🐣 🐔 🐤 🐓 , there is still no single emoji for 🔥 🐶 .

We are now starting to see an expansion of the emoji language, including some very American characters. Microsoft has just added  🖕 to [its keyboard in Windows 10](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-i-learned-to-love-writing-with-emojis/%20%3C/span%3E//blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/05/05/middle-finger-and-vulcan-salute-emojis-are-coming-to-windows-10/). (It isn’t available for Android or iOS). And both Microsoft and Apple now support 🖖. (You know, “Live long and prosper.”) In the years to come, we can expect more and more 🇺🇸 😃 .

# Learn on Apps

With a better understanding of the new vocabulary at my  ☝️ , I was ready to put it into use. But this is where our  📱  are failing us.

The  😃  keyboards on iPhone or Android   📱 are utterly disorganized and unfamiliar. Yes, they will automatically add your most used  😃  to one pane, but even if you get the hang of where some are located, you’re stuck swiping through pages of little cartoons.  
 I also fell in  ❤️ with Keymoji. Although it also doesn’t have the multiracial option, it suggests emoji as you type in regular text, right on top of the keyboard. And it doesn’t just suggest regular emojis. For instance, when I typed “long time no see” it suggested   📏 ⏰ 🙈  . Some emoji elitists may say this sort of thing is cheating, but I won’t tell anyone! 

 However, on a whole, Android users lack quality emoji characters and apps. The best I found for my needs was SwiftKey (also available on iOS). The popular keyboard app auto-suggests some emojis as you type, for instance  🍕 , 🍟 , 🍩  , but it isn’t as advanced as Keymoji. And none can make up for the fact that Google still hasn’t brought different skin tones and its human emojis look like the Minions from ""Despicable Me."" 

 This  ➕  another layer of confusion to communicating in emoji. Because the software platform creators control the visual representation, an emoji sent by an iPhone user to an Android phone user will  👀  different—in some cases, really different. Take my beloved  💃 . Red dress. Great moves. She can be used for many expressions from “social” to “party.” On Android, it’s  :android\_dancer: . Yes, a yellow blob with a rose in its mouth. Send that to someone, and the  🌹 🔫 . 

A few Android apps promise to ease the pain and translate Android emoji to iOS. The best one I found was Sliding Emoji Keyboard iOS, though it is slightly less convenient to switch to a dedicated emoji keyboard in Android than in iOS.

That brings us to my most important emoji learning of all:

 😜 👍️ 😃 ❗️ 🎂 🍣 ⚾️ 👍️ 😃 ❗️ 💞 💗 💖 👍️ 😃 ❗️ 

Playful chitchat, literal conversation and sentiment all benefit from these little characters.

 🍑 😐️ 💬 ➡️ 📧 ♏️ ⚽️ ☔️ 📍 🆓. 

But serious communication should stay emoji free."

heg3ph,Call me a simp,"Go ahead. Call me lonely 😔, a simp, or horny🥵🍆. These are MY FUCKING FEELINGS😤😍. I want to have the holiest✝️ and most devout prayer🙏 with Jesus Christ🙇🧔🏽. Seriously. His piety🛐, his grace, and His unending love❤️❣️ drive me to righteous madness🤪🤩. Every word😩 of His would be followed and revered🤩😌. When I want to worship🙇 and glorify His name, I would do it in a church⛪️, cathedral🏛, chapel, and get on my knees🧎 to scream 😫His glory to the highest🔝. I want to spread His gospel✉️, and ask him how His day was☺️😊. Feeling each other’s warmth 🥵 on our bodies free of sin☺️🙅. He’d tell me how saved 😌we can all be and confide His truest feelings🥰 of humanity 👨to me, telling me how much He loves❤️💘😍 me. I would tell Him I love Him🥰😘😍 back, and He would give me a loving peck😚 on my soul👻. Then we would get blessed🙏 and spend the day not watching the Sopranos🎷, because that show is for sinners👿, but cuddling👨‍❤️‍👨 and even eating 🤤our favorite foods🍔. I want Jesus to be my lord🥰, my savior😍, my messiah👼, and my life. I love❤️ Him, and I want Him to be mine☺️😊. Is this copy-paste? No🚫. I typed out⌨️ every word to proclaim how I feel☺️😊😌. Every time you ask who He is🤔, look back on this: HE IS MY KING OF KINGS👑👑💍. I love❤️ Jesus Christ🙏✝️, and these are MY original thoughts 💭and feelings😌."

That's great🥳, it starts with an earthquake〰️🌎
Birds🦅 and snakes🐍, an aeroplane🛩️
And Lenny Bruce is not afraid😎

Eye of a hurricane🌪️, listen to yourself churn💫
World serves its own needs🙄
Dummy🤭 serve your own needs😉
Speed it up a notch⚡, speed🦵, grunt🤬, no, strength💪
The ladder starts to clatter😳
With a fear of height😱, down😖, height😵
Wire in a fire🔥, representing seven games😈🎲
And a government for hire🇺🇸👩‍💼 and a combat site💥🔫
Left of west and coming in a hurry🙈
With the Furies👹 breathing down your neck🌬️😏

Team by team🥅, reporters baffled👊, trumped👊, tethered👊, cropped🤜🤜🤜🕵️‍♀️
Look at that low plane👆✈️, fine, then🙄🤷
Uh oh😳, overflow🌊😫, population👶👶👶👶👶😱, common group👨‍👩‍👦😵
But it'll do👍, save yourself🙌, serve yourself🤟
World serves its own needs🤷, listen to your heart bleed❣️
Tell me with the Rapture🛸👼 and the reverent in the right, right🙏🤵☑️
You vitriolic😈, patriotic🗽, slam fight🖐️💥, bright light☢️😵
Feeling pretty psyched😝😝😝

It's the end of the world as we know it💥🌎
It's the end of the world as we know it💥🌎

Six o'clock🕕, T.V. hour📺, don't get caught in foreign tower🤫😖
Slash and burn🔥🌳🌴, return↩️, listen to yourself churn💫
Lock him in uniform👮🔒, book burning🔥📚, bloodletting❣️👩‍⚕️
Every motive escalate🥊🔫, automotive incinerate🤯
Light a candle🕯️, light a votive🙏, step down, step down😥
Watch your heel crush🦶, crushed🦶, uh oh👀
This means no fear😤, cavalier🏇, renegade😈 and steering clear👉
A tournament⚔️, a tournament⚔️, a tournament of lies🙄🙄🙄
Offer me solutions💁, offer me alternatives🤷 and I decline🙅🙅🙅

It's the end of the world as we know it💥🌎 (I had some time alone😴)

Mountains sit in a line⛰️⛰️⛰️, Leonard Bernstein🧒
Leonid Brezhnev👴, Lenny Bruce👨 and Lester Bangs🧔
Birthday party🥳, cheesecake🎂, jellybean🍬, boom💼🤯

hbh517,(.)(.),"👩🏻‍🏫🧍🏻‍♀️Mrs. Teachington's 🏫boobs 🍈🍈 flopped from ⬅️side to side➡️ as she thanked 🙏🏻Tommy 👱🏻‍♂️for staying ⏰after class.📒

""Thank 🙏🏻you for ⏰staying 💦after class, 👱🏻‍♂️Tommy,"" she said, boobily💦❤️. ""You're probably ❓wondering❓🤔 why I asked 🗣you to stay after class📒. The reason ☝🏻I had you stay👇🏻 after class 📒is because 😱you're so hot.🔥🥵""

Tommy said, ""🤔🤯I think you're hot🔥 too. Do you want to have🍆💦🍑 sex with me?👅""

""Yes✔️,"" she said. Her boobs🔄 flopped faster in excitement👀😻. ""Thankfully, ✊🏻you are of legal🔞 age to have sex 🍆💦with me.""👩🏻‍🏫

""✔️Yes, I am,"" said Tommy. 👱🏻‍♂️""You can tell that there's proof 👌🏻👍🏻because I have a mustache.""👨🏻

Tommy 👱🏻‍♂️smiled😁, making his mustache spread👯 across his face. It was 😩badass.😎🥵

""Stand 😳⬆️up and show me your dinger🍆,"" said Mrs. Teachington. 👩🏻‍🏫""Then, I'll show 👀you my boobs🥵💦.""

Tommy laughed and said, ""Ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha! 🙅🏼‍♂️No, you show 👀me your 🥵💦boobs first🥇. Then🕑 I'll show 👀you my dinger🍆.""

👩🏻‍🏫Mrs. Teachington ❤️😩liked that, and it made her breathe 😤really hard because she was so 😈💦horny. Women 🧍🏻‍♀️love a man 🧍🏼who takes ⚡️charge⚡️ and makes them go first🥇. With one swift 💨💪🏻motion, she pulled 👚off her shirt, her other shirt, 👕and her bra. 👙Her boobs 👀😩flopped against her stomach 🤭because they were so huge. 🙈🙊They were at least 💯ZZZs. On the ends 🛑were circles 🅾️that sometimes 🤷🏼‍♂️babies 🤱🏼👶🏻use for milk. 🍼🥛They looked👀 like little hats.🕵🏻🎩

""Now 😩please show 👀me your noodle🍜🍆,"" she said.

Tommy 👱🏻‍♂️unbuttoned 👖his pants and then did a sweet back flip 🔄🤸🏻out of his jeans. 😱🥵They fell ⬇️to the floor🤪 right where ❓he was standing🕺🏼, and when he landed, his 🍆dingaling flopped 😩💦around. Mrs. Teachington 👩🏻‍🏫began to cry 😭🥺because it was so beautiful.🌅👼🏻

""❓Why are you 😭crying😢,"" asked Tommy👱🏻‍♂️. ""Did I hurt🚑 you with my back flip?""🤸🏻

""🚫No, it's just that your 🍆🥺winkie is so 🌅beautiful,"" she said. ""It has🥵 to be at least a 😱thousand inches 📏long. Since you're a 🚹man and I'm a 🚺woman, and we 💕💗love each other very ✝️much, let's rub 😚our thingies🍆🍑 together to make a baby🤰🏼.""

Tommy👱🏻‍♂️ held out his hand🖐🏻 and yelled🗣, ""NO!🚫"" Mrs. Teachington👩🏻‍🏫 🛑stopped 🛑and her 🤤🥵boobs flopped 🤪around from stopping so fast.😩

""But ❓why❓, Tommy🤷🏻‍♀️? Don't you want to do 💦🍆sex 🍑with me?""

""I do,"" 😌😇said Tommy. ""But 🥇first, we have to use protection🥊 so that you don't🚫 have a baby👶🏻 and so that 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨we don't get diseases 🦠🧬that will ruin☠️ our lives. I will use a condom😈, because 🍆💦condoms are what 🛑stops babies 👶🏻and diseases 🦠from happening.""☠️☠️

👱🏻‍♂️Tommy 😩pulled a condom 😈out of his pocket and blew 🌬it up ⬆️and tied 🎀the end to his peeper😳. It looked like a boob.😫

""There😜👍🏻,"" said 👱🏻‍♂️Tommy. ""Now😌 we can do sex🍆💦and a baby👶🏻 will not 🚫come out of your butt🍑.""

""You are 👨🏼‍🎓smart, 📝Tommy. The 🧐smartest man 🧍🏼in the whole 🏫school.""

""🙏🏻Thank you,"" said Tommy👱🏻‍♂️. ""Now 😈take off your 💦👙underwear, and we can do 🍆🍑sex. Don't be ashamed🙈 about your no-no🚫😌 area. I already know 👨🏼‍🎓that you don't have a penis🍆, because 🚺🚫girls don't have a 🍆penis. Only 🚹✔️boys have a 🍆penis. Girls🚺 have a 🙈vagina🥵 on their 🍑butts.""

""That is ✅right✅,"" said Mrs. Teachington. 👩🏻‍🏫Then she let 👀Tommy👱🏻‍♂️ touch👄 her 🥵🥵boobs. They were soft 😩🙈and they jiggled. 🍮🌚Tommy's 👱🏻‍♂️wanger 🍆💦got even bigger👀, and Mrs. Teachington👩🏻‍🏫 cried 😭even harder😩😩. When she was done 😭😭😭crying, 👱🏻‍♂️Tommy got behind 👀her and 🙈rubbed his dong 🍆on her butt.🍑💦

""Yes✅, yes✅, yes✅,"" she yelled 🗣as he 👅👀rubbed faster💪🏻, and then white pee 💦came out and bounced 😩🍆off of the condom 😈so that they didn't 🚫have a 🤰🏼baby or make a 🦠disease.

""That 🏆was the best👌🏻👅 sex 🍆💦I ever had,"" said Mrs. Teachington.👩🏻‍🏫

‼️Just then, 🧑🏻‍🦱Kevin Janson came in and said, ""There🤬 you are! I'm going to beat 🤼‍♂️you up because I'm 😱jealous🤢 of you!"" And he was holding a knife.🔪

👱🏻‍♂️Tommy did another back🌀🤸🏻 flip and 🎯aimed his giant 🍆💦willy at Kevin's🧑🏻‍🦱 hand🥵🙌🏻. It flopped😹 against his 🤚🏻hand and😼 made the🔪 knife 😩😱shoot out. ‼️👱🏻‍♂️Tommy 🛬landed and pulled 🙀🙉🙈out a gun🔫 and shot 🧑🏻‍🦱Kevin right in the face😳☠️.

""😪Noooooo,"" Kevin screamed😱. And then he fell over dead. 👻☠️☠️Kevin's mom 👩🏻‍🦰came in just 😳🤯then and began to laugh.

""😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha 😂ha! I ♾🕚always hated🤬👎🏻 Kevin🧑🏻‍🦱 because he's a 😪👎🏻butthole🙊. He 👺picks on other👿 people for no reason❓, and 🤷🏼‍♂️nobody ever 🙅🏼‍♂️does anything 🤼‍♂️about it. 😓😔He never gets in trouble😤🥺. Thank 🙏🏻you, Tommy!""👱🏻‍♂️

Tommy 🗣said, ""You're 👍🏻welcome.""👀👅

Then😯 Kevin's mom 👩🏻‍🦰started 👅👀rubbing her boobs. 🥵😋Mrs. Teachington 😜👩🏻‍🏫started rubbing her 🍉💦boobs, too, and they 👩🏻‍🏫👩🏻‍🦰both said at the 🤪🤯same time, ""Please😩🙏🏻 have sex 🍆💦🍑🍑with both ✌🏻🤞🏻👅of us, Tommy👱🏻‍♂️.""

Tommy 👅👀🍆rubbed his wang-a-lang😩💦 on their butts🍑🍑, and they rubbed🥵🙀 their boobs 👍🏻🤪on each others' boobs🍉🍌. 🥳🤯Tommy was 👍🏻👱🏻‍♂️so good at it that he had sex 🍆💦for 200 hours, 🥇⏱and Mrs. Teachington 👩🏻‍🏫and Kevin's mom 👩🏻‍🦰gave him a brand new 🤯😩PlayStation 4.🎮🏆

The end.😽😻"
